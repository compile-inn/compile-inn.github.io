made him unconscious of\nthe falling day and creeping shadows", "Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky gleamed\nthrough the windows", "He read on by its wan light till he could read no\nmore", "Then, after his valet had reminded him several times of the\nlateness of the hour, he got up, and going into the next room, placed\nthe book on the little Florentine table that always stood at his\nbedside and began to dress for dinner", "It was almost nine o\u2019clock before he reached the club, where he found\nLord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very much bored", "\u201cI am so sorry, Harry,\u201d he cried, \u201cbut really it is entirely your\nfault", "That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the\ntime was going", "\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I thought you would like it,\u201d replied his host, rising from his\nchair", "\u201cI didn\u2019t say I liked it, Harry", "I said it fascinated me", "There is a\ngreat difference", "\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, you have discovered that?\u201d murmured Lord Henry", "And they passed\ninto the dining-room", "CHAPTER XI", "For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of\nthis book", "Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never\nsought to free himself from it", "He procured from Paris no less than\nnine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in\ndifferent colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the\nchanging fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have\nalmost entirely lost control", "The hero, the wonderful young Parisian in\nwhom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely\nblended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself", "And,\nindeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own\nlife, written before he had lived it", "In one point he was more fortunate than the novel\u2019s fantastic hero", "He\nnever knew\u2014never, indeed, had any cause to know\u2014that somewhat grotesque\ndread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water which\ncame upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned\nby the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently, been so\nremarkable", "It was with an almost cruel joy\u2014and perhaps in nearly every\njoy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its place\u2014that he used\nto read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if\nsomewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who\nhad himself lost what in others, and the world, he had most dearly\nvalued", "For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and\nmany others besides him, seemed never to leave him", "Even those who had\nheard the most evil things against him\u2014and from time to time strange\nrumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the\nchatter of the clubs\u2014could not believe anything to his dishonour when\nthey saw him", "He had always the look of one who had kept himself\nunspotted from the world", "Men who talked grossly became silent when\nDorian Gray entered the room", "There was something in the purity of his\nface that rebuked them", "His mere presence seemed to recall to them the\nmemory of the innocence that they had tarnished", "They wondered how one\nso charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an\nage that was at once sordid and sensual", "Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged\nabsences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were\nhis friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep\nupstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left\nhim now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil\nHallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on\nthe canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him\nfrom the polished glass", "The very sharpness of the contrast used to\nquicken his sense of pleasure", "He grew more and more enamoured of his\nown beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul", "He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and\nterrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead\nor crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which\nwere the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age", "He would\nplace his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture,\nand smile", "He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs", "There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own\ndelicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little\nill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in\ndisguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he\nhad brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant\nbecause it was purely selfish", "But moments such as these were rare", "That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as\nthey sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase\nwith gratification", "The more he knew, the more he desired to know", "He\nhad mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them", "Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to\nsociety", "Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each\nWednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the\nworld his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the\nday to charm his guests with the wonders of their art", "His little\ndinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were\nnoted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited,\nas for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with\nits subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered\ncloths, and antique plate of gold and silver", "Indeed, there were many,\nespecially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw,\nin Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often\ndreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of\nthe real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and\nperfect manner of a citizen of the world", "To them he seemed to be of\nthe company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to \u201cmake\nthemselves perfect by the worship of beauty", "\u201d Like Gautier, he was one\nfor whom \u201cthe visible world existed", "\u201d\n\nAnd, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the\narts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation", "Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment\nuniversal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert\nthe absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for\nhim", "His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to\ntime he affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of\nthe Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in\neverything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of\nhis graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies", "For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost\nimmediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a\nsubtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the\nLondon of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the\nSatyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be\nsomething more than a mere _arbiter elegantiarum_, to be consulted on\nthe wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of\na cane", "He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have\nits reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the\nspiritualizing of the senses its highest realization", "The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been\ndecried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and\nsensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are\nconscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence", "But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had\nnever been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal\nmerely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or\nto kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a\nnew spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the\ndominant characteristic", "As he looked back upon man moving through\nhistory, he was haunted by a feeling of loss", "So much had been\nsurrendered! and to such little purpose! There had been mad wilful\nrejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose\norigin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more\nterrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance,\nthey had sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out\nthe anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to\nthe hermit the beasts of the field as his companions", "Yes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that\nwas to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism\nthat is having, in our own day, its curious revival", "It was to have its\nservice of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to accept any\ntheory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of\npassionate experience", "Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself,\nand not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be", "Of\nthe asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy\nthat dulls them, it was to know nothing", "But it was to teach man to\nconcentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a\nmoment", "There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either\nafter one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of\ndeath, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through\nthe chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality\nitself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques,\nand that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one\nmight fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled\nwith the malady of reverie", "Gradually white fingers creep through the\ncurtains, and they appear to tremble", "In black fantastic shapes, dumb\nshadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there", "Outside,\nthere is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men\ngoing forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down\nfrom the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it\nfeared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from\nher purple cave", "Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by\ndegrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we\nwatch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern", "The wan\nmirrors get back their mimic life", "The flameless tapers stand where we\nhad left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been\nstudying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the\nletter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often", "Nothing seems to us changed", "Out of the unreal shadows of the night\ncomes back the real life that we had known", "We have to resume it where\nwe had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the\nnecessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of\nstereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids\nmight open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in\nthe darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh\nshapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in\nwhich the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate,\nin no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of\njoy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain", "It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray\nto be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his\nsearch for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and\npossess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he\nwould often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really\nalien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and\nthen, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his\nintellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that\nis not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that,\nindeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition\nof it", "It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman\nCatholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great\nattraction for him", "The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the\nsacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its superb\nrejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity\nof its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it\nsought to symbolize", "He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement\nand watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with\nwhite hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft\nthe jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at\ntimes, one would fain think, is indeed the \u201c_panis c\u00e6lestis_,\u201d the\nbread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ,\nbreaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins", "The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet,\ntossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle\nfascination for him", "As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at\nthe black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of\nthem and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating\nthe true story of their lives", "But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual\ndevelopment by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of\nmistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable\nfor the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which\nthere are no stars and the moon is in travail", "Mysticism, with its\nmarvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle\nantinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a\nseason; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of\nthe _Darwinismus_ movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in\ntracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the\nbrain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of\nthe absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions,\nmorbid or healthy, normal or diseased", "Yet, as has been said of him\nbefore, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance\ncompared with life itself", "He felt keenly conscious of how barren all\nintellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment", "He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual\nmysteries to reveal", "And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their\nmanufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums\nfrom the East", "He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not\nits counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their\ntrue relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one\nmystical, and in ambergris that stirred one\u2019s passions, and in violets\nthat woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the\nbrain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often\nto elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several\ninfluences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers;\nof aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that\nsickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to\nbe able to expel melancholy from the soul", "At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long\nlatticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of\nolive-green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad\ngipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave, yellow-shawled\nTunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while\ngrinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and, crouching\nupon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of\nreed or brass and charmed\u2014or feigned to charm\u2014great hooded snakes and\nhorrible horned adders", "The harsh intervals and shrill discords of\nbarbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert\u2019s grace, and Chopin\u2019s\nbeautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell\nunheeded on his ear", "He collected together from all parts of the world\nthe strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of\ndead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact\nwith Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try them", "He had the\nmysterious _juruparis_ of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not\nallowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been\nsubjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the\nPeruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human\nbones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green\njaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular\nsweetness", "He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when\nthey were shaken; the long _clarin_ of the Mexicans, into which the\nperformer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the\nharsh _ture_ of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who\nsit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a\ndistance of three leagues; the _teponaztli_, that has two vibrating\ntongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an\nelastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the _yotl_-bells\nof the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge\ncylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the\none that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican\ntemple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a\ndescription", "The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated\nhim, and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like\nNature, has her monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous\nvoices", "Yet, after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his\nbox at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt\npleasure to \u201cTannhauser\u201d and seeing in the prelude to that great work\nof art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul", "On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a\ncostume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered\nwith five hundred and sixty pearls", "This taste enthralled him for\nyears, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him", "He would often\nspend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various\nstones that he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that\nturns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver,\nthe pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes,\ncarbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous, four-rayed stars, flame-red\ncinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their\nalternate layers of ruby and sapphire", "He loved the red gold of the\nsunstone, and the moonstone\u2019s pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow\nof the milky opal", "He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of\nextraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise _de la\nvieille roche_ that was the envy of all the connoisseurs", "He discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels", "In Alphonso\u2019s\nClericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real\njacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of\nEmathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan snakes \u201cwith\ncollars of real emeralds growing on their backs", "\u201d There was a gem in\nthe brain of the dragon,

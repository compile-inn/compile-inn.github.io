["CHAPTER I", "Manfred, Prince of Otranto, had one son and one daughter: the latter, a\nmost beautiful virgin, aged eighteen, was called Matilda", "Conrad, the\nson, was three years younger, a homely youth, sickly, and of no promising\ndisposition; yet he was the darling of his father, who never showed any\nsymptoms of affection to Matilda", "Manfred had contracted a marriage for\nhis son with the Marquis of Vicenza\u2019s daughter, Isabella; and she had\nalready been delivered by her guardians into the hands of Manfred, that\nhe might celebrate the wedding as soon as Conrad\u2019s infirm state of health\nwould permit", "Manfred\u2019s impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family and\nneighbours", "The former, indeed, apprehending the severity of their\nPrince\u2019s disposition, did not dare to utter their surmises on this\nprecipitation", "Hippolita, his wife, an amiable lady, did sometimes\nventure to represent the danger of marrying their only son so early,\nconsidering his great youth, and greater infirmities; but she never\nreceived any other answer than reflections on her own sterility, who had\ngiven him but one heir", "His tenants and subjects were less cautious in\ntheir discourses", "They attributed this hasty wedding to the Prince\u2019s\ndread of seeing accomplished an ancient prophecy, which was said to have\npronounced that the castle and lordship of Otranto \u201cshould pass from the\npresent family, whenever the real owner should be grown too large to\ninhabit it", "\u201d It was difficult to make any sense of this prophecy; and\nstill less easy to conceive what it had to do with the marriage in\nquestion", "Yet these mysteries, or contradictions, did not make the\npopulace adhere the less to their opinion", "Young Conrad\u2019s birthday was fixed for his espousals", "The company was\nassembled in the chapel of the Castle, and everything ready for beginning\nthe divine office, when Conrad himself was missing", "Manfred, impatient\nof the least delay, and who had not observed his son retire, despatched\none of his attendants to summon the young Prince", "The servant, who had\nnot stayed long enough to have crossed the court to Conrad\u2019s apartment,\ncame running back breathless, in a frantic manner, his eyes staring, and\nfoaming at the mouth", "He said nothing, but pointed to the court", "The company were struck with terror and amazement", "The Princess\nHippolita, without knowing what was the matter, but anxious for her son,\nswooned away", "Manfred, less apprehensive than enraged at the\nprocrastination of the nuptials, and at the folly of his domestic, asked\nimperiously what was the matter? The fellow made no answer, but\ncontinued pointing towards the courtyard; and at last, after repeated\nquestions put to him, cried out, \u201cOh! the helmet! the helmet!\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, some of the company had run into the court, from whence\nwas heard a confused noise of shrieks, horror, and surprise", "Manfred,\nwho began to be alarmed at not seeing his son, went himself to get\ninformation of what occasioned this strange confusion", "Matilda remained\nendeavouring to assist her mother, and Isabella stayed for the same\npurpose, and to avoid showing any impatience for the bridegroom, for\nwhom, in truth, she had conceived little affection", "The first thing that struck Manfred\u2019s eyes was a group of his servants\nendeavouring to raise something that appeared to him a mountain of sable\nplumes", "He gazed without believing his sight", "\u201cWhat are ye doing?\u201d cried Manfred, wrathfully; \u201cwhere is my son?\u201d\n\nA volley of voices replied, \u201cOh! my Lord! the Prince! the Prince! the\nhelmet! the helmet!\u201d\n\nShocked with these lamentable sounds, and dreading he knew not what, he\nadvanced hastily,\u2014but what a sight for a father\u2019s eyes!\u2014he beheld his\nchild dashed to pieces, and almost buried under an enormous helmet, an\nhundred times more large than any casque ever made for human being, and\nshaded with a proportionable quantity of black feathers", "The horror of the spectacle, the ignorance of all around how this\nmisfortune had happened, and above all, the tremendous phenomenon before\nhim, took away the Prince\u2019s speech", "Yet his silence lasted longer than\neven grief could occasion", "He fixed his eyes on what he wished in vain\nto believe a vision; and seemed less attentive to his loss, than buried\nin meditation on the stupendous object that had occasioned it", "He\ntouched, he examined the fatal casque; nor could even the bleeding\nmangled remains of the young Prince divert the eyes of Manfred from the\nportent before him", "All who had known his partial fondness for young Conrad, were as much\nsurprised at their Prince\u2019s insensibility, as thunderstruck themselves at\nthe miracle of the helmet", "They conveyed the disfigured corpse into the\nhall, without receiving the least direction from Manfred", "As little was\nhe attentive to the ladies who remained in the chapel", "On the contrary,\nwithout mentioning the unhappy princesses, his wife and daughter, the\nfirst sounds that dropped from Manfred\u2019s lips were, \u201cTake care of the\nLady Isabella", "\u201d\n\nThe domestics, without observing the singularity of this direction, were\nguided by their affection to their mistress, to consider it as peculiarly\naddressed to her situation, and flew to her assistance", "They conveyed\nher to her chamber more dead than alive, and indifferent to all the\nstrange circumstances she heard, except the death of her son", "Matilda, who doted on her mother, smothered her own grief and amazement,\nand thought of nothing but assisting and comforting her afflicted parent", "Isabella, who had been treated by Hippolita like a daughter, and who\nreturned that tenderness with equal duty and affection, was scarce less\nassiduous about the Princess; at the same time endeavouring to partake\nand lessen the weight of sorrow which she saw Matilda strove to suppress,\nfor whom she had conceived the warmest sympathy of friendship", "Yet her\nown situation could not help finding its place in her thoughts", "She felt\nno concern for the death of young Conrad, except commiseration; and she\nwas not sorry to be delivered from a marriage which had promised her\nlittle felicity, either from her destined bridegroom, or from the severe\ntemper of Manfred, who, though he had distinguished her by great\nindulgence, had imprinted her mind with terror, from his causeless rigour\nto such amiable princesses as Hippolita and Matilda", "While the ladies were conveying the wretched mother to her bed, Manfred\nremained in the court, gazing on the ominous casque, and regardless of\nthe crowd which the strangeness of the event had now assembled around\nhim", "The few words he articulated, tended solely to inquiries, whether\nany man knew from whence it could have come? Nobody could give him the\nleast information", "However, as it seemed to be the sole object of his\ncuriosity, it soon became so to the rest of the spectators, whose\nconjectures were as absurd and improbable, as the catastrophe itself was\nunprecedented", "In the midst of their senseless guesses, a young peasant,\nwhom rumour had drawn thither from a neighbouring village, observed that\nthe miraculous helmet was exactly like that on the figure in black marble\nof Alfonso the Good, one of their former princes, in the church of St", "Nicholas", "\u201cVillain! What sayest thou?\u201d cried Manfred, starting from his trance in\na tempest of rage, and seizing the young man by the collar; \u201chow darest\nthou utter such treason? Thy life shall pay for it", "\u201d\n\nThe spectators, who as little comprehended the cause of the Prince\u2019s fury\nas all the rest they had seen, were at a loss to unravel this new\ncircumstance", "The young peasant himself was still more astonished, not\nconceiving how he had offended the Prince", "Yet recollecting himself,\nwith a mixture of grace and humility, he disengaged himself from\nManfred\u2019s grip, and then with an obeisance, which discovered more\njealousy of innocence than dismay, he asked, with respect, of what he was\nguilty? Manfred, more enraged at the vigour, however decently exerted,\nwith which the young man had shaken off his hold, than appeased by his\nsubmission, ordered his attendants to seize him, and, if he had not been\nwithheld by his friends whom he had invited to the nuptials, would have\npoignarded the peasant in their arms", "During this altercation, some of the vulgar spectators had run to the\ngreat church, which stood near the castle, and came back open-mouthed,\ndeclaring that the helmet was missing from Alfonso\u2019s statue", "Manfred, at\nthis news, grew perfectly frantic; and, as if he sought a subject on\nwhich to vent the tempest within him, he rushed again on the young\npeasant, crying\u2014\n\n\u201cVillain! Monster! Sorcerer! \u2019tis thou hast done this! \u2019tis thou hast\nslain my son!\u201d\n\nThe mob, who wanted some object within the scope of their capacities, on\nwhom they might discharge their bewildered reasoning, caught the words\nfrom the mouth of their lord, and re-echoed\u2014\n\n\u201cAy, ay; \u2019tis he, \u2019tis he: he has stolen the helmet from good Alfonso\u2019s\ntomb, and dashed out the brains of our young Prince with it,\u201d never\nreflecting how enormous the disproportion was between the marble helmet\nthat had been in the church, and that of steel before their eyes; nor how\nimpossible it was for a youth seemingly not twenty, to wield a piece of\narmour of so prodigious a weight", "The folly of these ejaculations brought Manfred to himself: yet whether\nprovoked at the peasant having observed the resemblance between the two\nhelmets, and thereby led to the farther discovery of the absence of that\nin the church, or wishing to bury any such rumour under so impertinent a\nsupposition, he gravely pronounced that the young man was certainly a\nnecromancer, and that till the Church could take cognisance of the\naffair, he would have the Magician, whom they had thus detected, kept\nprisoner under the helmet itself, which he ordered his attendants to\nraise, and place the young man under it; declaring he should be kept\nthere without food, with which his own infernal art might furnish him", "It was in vain for the youth to represent against this preposterous\nsentence: in vain did Manfred\u2019s friends endeavour to divert him from this\nsavage and ill-grounded resolution", "The generality were charmed with\ntheir lord\u2019s decision, which, to their apprehensions, carried great\nappearance of justice, as the Magician was to be punished by the very\ninstrument with which he had offended: nor were they struck with the\nleast compunction at the probability of the youth being starved, for they\nfirmly believed that, by his diabolic skill, he could easily supply\nhimself with nutriment", "Manfred thus saw his commands even cheerfully obeyed; and appointing a\nguard with strict orders to prevent any food being conveyed to the\nprisoner, he dismissed his friends and attendants, and retired to his own\nchamber, after locking the gates of the castle, in which he suffered none\nbut his domestics to remain", "In the meantime, the care and zeal of the young Ladies had brought the\nPrincess Hippolita to herself, who amidst the transports of her own\nsorrow frequently demanded news of her lord, would have dismissed her\nattendants to watch over him, and at last enjoined Matilda to leave her,\nand visit and comfort her father", "Matilda, who wanted no affectionate\nduty to Manfred, though she trembled at his austerity, obeyed the orders\nof Hippolita, whom she tenderly recommended to Isabella; and inquiring of\nthe domestics for her father, was informed that he was retired to his\nchamber, and had commanded that nobody should have admittance to him", "Concluding that he was immersed in sorrow for the death of her brother,\nand fearing to renew his tears by the sight of his sole remaining child,\nshe hesitated whether she should break in upon his affliction; yet\nsolicitude for him, backed by the commands of her mother, encouraged her\nto venture disobeying the orders he had given; a fault she had never been\nguilty of before", "The gentle timidity of her nature made her pause for some minutes at his\ndoor", "She heard him traverse his chamber backwards, and forwards with\ndisordered steps; a mood which increased her apprehensions", "She was,\nhowever, just going to beg admittance, when Manfred suddenly opened the\ndoor; and as it was now twilight, concurring with the disorder of his\nmind, he did not distinguish the person, but asked angrily, who it was?\nMatilda replied, trembling\u2014\n\n\u201cMy dearest father, it is I, your daughter", "\u201d\n\nManfred, stepping back hastily, cried, \u201cBegone! I do not want a\ndaughter;\u201d and flinging back abruptly, clapped the door against the\nterrified Matilda", "She was too well acquainted with her father\u2019s impetuosity to venture a\nsecond intrusion", "When she had a little recovered the shock of so bitter\na reception, she wiped away her tears to prevent the additional stab that\nthe knowledge of it would give to Hippolita, who questioned her in the\nmost anxious terms on the health of Manfred, and how he bore his loss", "Matilda assured her he was well, and supported his misfortune with manly\nfortitude", "\u201cBut will he not let me see him?\u201d said Hippolita mournfully; \u201cwill he not\npermit me to blend my tears with his, and shed a mother\u2019s sorrows in the\nbosom of her Lord? Or do you deceive me, Matilda? I know how Manfred\ndoted on his son: is not the stroke too heavy for him? has he not sunk\nunder it? You do not answer me\u2014alas! I dread the worst!\u2014Raise me, my\nmaidens; I will, I will see my Lord", "Bear me to him instantly: he is\ndearer to me even than my children", "\u201d\n\nMatilda made signs to Isabella to prevent Hippolita\u2019s rising; and both\nthose lovely young women were using their gentle violence to stop and\ncalm the Princess, when a servant, on the part of Manfred, arrived and\ntold Isabella that his Lord demanded to speak with her", "\u201cWith me!\u201d cried Isabella", "\u201cGo,\u201d said Hippolita, relieved by a message from her Lord: \u201cManfred\ncannot support the sight of his own family", "He thinks you less\ndisordered than we are, and dreads the shock of my grief", "Console him,\ndear Isabella, and tell him I will smother my own anguish rather than add\nto his", "\u201d\n\nAs it was now evening the servant who conducted Isabella bore a torch\nbefore her", "When they came to Manfred, who was walking impatiently about\nthe gallery, he started, and said hastily\u2014\n\n\u201cTake away that light, and begone", "\u201d\n\nThen shutting the door impetuously, he flung himself upon a bench against\nthe wall, and bade Isabella sit by him", "She obeyed trembling", "\u201cI sent for you, Lady,\u201d said he\u2014and then stopped under great appearance\nof confusion", "\u201cMy Lord!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I sent for you on a matter of great moment,\u201d resumed he", "\u201cDry your\ntears, young Lady\u2014you have lost your bridegroom", "Yes, cruel fate! and I\nhave lost the hopes of my race! But Conrad was not worthy of your\nbeauty", "\u201d\n\n\u201cHow, my Lord!\u201d said Isabella; \u201csure you do not suspect me of not feeling\nthe concern I ought: my duty and affection would have always\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThink no more of him,\u201d interrupted Manfred; \u201che was a sickly, puny\nchild, and Heaven has perhaps taken him away, that I might not trust the\nhonours of my house on so frail a foundation", "The line of Manfred calls\nfor numerous supports", "My foolish fondness for that boy blinded the eyes\nof my prudence\u2014but it is better as it is", "I hope, in a few years, to\nhave reason to rejoice at the death of Conrad", "\u201d\n\nWords cannot paint the astonishment of Isabella", "At first she\napprehended that grief had disordered Manfred\u2019s understanding", "Her next\nthought suggested that this strange discourse was designed to ensnare\nher: she feared that Manfred had perceived her indifference for his son:\nand in consequence of that idea she replied\u2014\n\n\u201cGood my Lord, do not doubt my tenderness: my heart would have\naccompanied my hand", "Conrad would have engrossed all my care; and\nwherever fate shall dispose of me, I shall always cherish his memory, and\nregard your Highness and the virtuous Hippolita as my parents", "\u201d\n\n\u201cCurse on Hippolita!\u201d cried Manfred", "\u201cForget her from this moment, as I\ndo", "In short, Lady, you have missed a husband undeserving of your\ncharms: they shall now be better disposed of", "Instead of a sickly boy,\nyou shall have a husband in the prime of his age, who will know how to\nvalue your beauties, and who may expect a numerous offspring", "\u201d\n\n\u201cAlas, my Lord!\u201d said Isabella, \u201cmy mind is too sadly engrossed by the\nrecent catastrophe in your family to think of another marriage", "If ever\nmy father returns, and it shall be his pleasure, I shall obey, as I did\nwhen I consented to give my hand to your son: but until his return,\npermit me to remain under your hospitable roof, and employ the melancholy\nhours in assuaging yours, Hippolita\u2019s, and the fair Matilda\u2019s\naffliction", "\u201d\n\n\u201cI desired you once before,\u201d said Manfred angrily, \u201cnot to name that\nwoman: from this hour she must be a stranger to you, as she must be to\nme", "In short, Isabella, since I cannot give you my son, I offer you\nmyself", "\u201d\n\n\u201cHeavens!\u201d cried Isabella, waking from her delusion, \u201cwhat do I hear?\nYou! my Lord!

Madam,\u201d said Bianca, \u201call men use their wives so, when they are\nweary of them", "\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet you congratulated me but now,\u201d said Matilda, \u201cwhen you fancied\nmy father intended to dispose of me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have you a great Lady,\u201d replied Bianca, \u201ccome what will", "I do\nnot wish to see you moped in a convent, as you would be if you had your\nwill, and if my Lady, your mother, who knows that a bad husband is better\nthan no husband at all, did not hinder you", "\u2014Bless me! what noise is that!\nSt", "Nicholas forgive me! I was but in jest", "\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the wind,\u201d said Matilda, \u201cwhistling through the battlements in the\ntower above: you have heard it a thousand times", "\u201d\n\n\u201cNay,\u201d said Bianca, \u201cthere was no harm neither in what I said: it is no\nsin to talk of matrimony\u2014and so, Madam, as I was saying, if my Lord\nManfred should offer you a handsome young Prince for a bridegroom, you\nwould drop him a curtsey, and tell him you would rather take the veil?\u201d\n\n\u201cThank Heaven! I am in no such danger,\u201d said Matilda: \u201cyou know how many\nproposals for me he has rejected\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you thank him, like a dutiful daughter, do you, Madam? But come,\nMadam; suppose, to-morrow morning, he was to send for you to the great\ncouncil chamber, and there you should find at his elbow a lovely young\nPrince, with large black eyes, a smooth white forehead, and manly curling\nlocks like jet; in short, Madam, a young hero resembling the picture of\nthe good Alfonso in the gallery, which you sit and gaze at for hours\ntogether\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not speak lightly of that picture,\u201d interrupted Matilda sighing; \u201cI\nknow the adoration with which I look at that picture is uncommon\u2014but I am\nnot in love with a coloured panel", "The character of that virtuous\nPrince, the veneration with which my mother has inspired me for his\nmemory, the orisons which, I know not why, she has enjoined me to pour\nforth at his tomb, all have concurred to persuade me that somehow or\nother my destiny is linked with something relating to him", "\u201d\n\n\u201cLord, Madam! how should that be?\u201d said Bianca; \u201cI have always heard that\nyour family was in no way related to his: and I am sure I cannot conceive\nwhy my Lady, the Princess, sends you in a cold morning or a damp evening\nto pray at his tomb: he is no saint by the almanack", "If you must pray,\nwhy does she not bid you address yourself to our great St", "Nicholas? I\nam sure he is the saint I pray to for a husband", "\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps my mind would be less affected,\u201d said Matilda, \u201cif my mother\nwould explain her reasons to me: but it is the mystery she observes, that\ninspires me with this\u2014I know not what to call it", "As she never acts from\ncaprice, I am sure there is some fatal secret at bottom\u2014nay, I know there\nis: in her agony of grief for my brother\u2019s death she dropped some words\nthat intimated as much", "\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! dear Madam,\u201d cried Bianca, \u201cwhat were they?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Matilda, \u201cif a parent lets fall a word, and wishes it\nrecalled, it is not for a child to utter it", "\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! was she sorry for what she had said?\u201d asked Bianca; \u201cI am sure,\nMadam, you may trust me\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWith my own little secrets when I have any, I may,\u201d said Matilda; \u201cbut\nnever with my mother\u2019s: a child ought to have no ears or eyes but as a\nparent directs", "\u201d\n\n\u201cWell! to be sure, Madam, you were born to be a saint,\u201d said Bianca, \u201cand\nthere is no resisting one\u2019s vocation: you will end in a convent at last", "But there is my Lady Isabella would not be so reserved to me: she will\nlet me talk to her of young men: and when a handsome cavalier has come to\nthe castle, she has owned to me that she wished your brother Conrad\nresembled him", "\u201d\n\n\u201cBianca,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cI do not allow you to mention my friend\ndisrespectfully", "Isabella is of a cheerful disposition, but her soul is\npure as virtue itself", "She knows your idle babbling humour, and perhaps\nhas now and then encouraged it, to divert melancholy, and enliven the\nsolitude in which my father keeps us\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBlessed Mary!\u201d said Bianca, starting, \u201cthere it is again! Dear Madam,\ndo you hear nothing? this castle is certainly haunted!\u201d\n\n\u201cPeace!\u201d said Matilda, \u201cand listen! I did think I heard a voice\u2014but it\nmust be fancy: your terrors, I suppose, have infected me", "\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed! indeed! Madam,\u201d said Bianca, half-weeping with agony, \u201cI am\nsure I heard a voice", "\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes anybody lie in the chamber beneath?\u201d said the Princess", "\u201cNobody has dared to lie there,\u201d answered Bianca, \u201csince the great\nastrologer, that was your brother\u2019s tutor, drowned himself", "For certain,\nMadam, his ghost and the young Prince\u2019s are now met in the chamber\nbelow\u2014for Heaven\u2019s sake let us fly to your mother\u2019s apartment!\u201d\n\n\u201cI charge you not to stir,\u201d said Matilda", "\u201cIf they are spirits in pain,\nwe may ease their sufferings by questioning them", "They can mean no hurt\nto us, for we have not injured them\u2014and if they should, shall we be more\nsafe in one chamber than in another? Reach me my beads; we will say a\nprayer, and then speak to them", "\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! dear Lady, I would not speak to a ghost for the world!\u201d cried\nBianca", "As she said those words they heard the casement of the little\nchamber below Matilda\u2019s open", "They listened attentively, and in a few\nminutes thought they heard a person sing, but could not distinguish the\nwords", "\u201cThis can be no evil spirit,\u201d said the Princess, in a low voice; \u201cit is\nundoubtedly one of the family\u2014open the window, and we shall know the\nvoice", "\u201d\n\n\u201cI dare not, indeed, Madam,\u201d said Bianca", "\u201cThou art a very fool,\u201d said Matilda, opening the window gently herself", "The noise the Princess made was, however, heard by the person beneath,\nwho stopped; and they concluded had heard the casement open", "\u201cIs anybody below?\u201d said the Princess; \u201cif there is, speak", "\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said an unknown voice", "\u201cWho is it?\u201d said Matilda", "\u201cA stranger,\u201d replied the voice", "\u201cWhat stranger?\u201d said she; \u201cand how didst thou come there at this unusual\nhour, when all the gates of the castle are locked?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not here willingly,\u201d answered the voice", "\u201cBut pardon me, Lady, if\nI have disturbed your rest; I knew not that I was overheard", "Sleep had\nforsaken me; I left a restless couch, and came to waste the irksome hours\nwith gazing on the fair approach of morning, impatient to be dismissed\nfrom this castle", "\u201d\n\n\u201cThy words and accents,\u201d said Matilda, \u201care of melancholy cast; if thou\nart unhappy, I pity thee", "If poverty afflicts thee, let me know it; I\nwill mention thee to the Princess, whose beneficent soul ever melts for\nthe distressed, and she will relieve thee", "\u201d\n\n\u201cI am indeed unhappy,\u201d said the stranger; \u201cand I know not what wealth is", "But I do not complain of the lot which Heaven has cast for me; I am young\nand healthy, and am not ashamed of owing my support to myself\u2014yet think\nme not proud, or that I disdain your generous offers", "I will remember\nyou in my orisons, and will pray for blessings on your gracious self and\nyour noble mistress\u2014if I sigh, Lady, it is for others, not for myself", "\u201d\n\n\u201cNow I have it, Madam,\u201d said Bianca, whispering the Princess; \u201cthis is\ncertainly the young peasant; and, by my conscience, he is in love\u2014Well!\nthis is a charming adventure!\u2014do, Madam, let us sift him", "He does not\nknow you, but takes you for one of my Lady Hippolita\u2019s women", "\u201d\n\n\u201cArt thou not ashamed, Bianca!\u201d said the Princess", "\u201cWhat right have we\nto pry into the secrets of this young man\u2019s heart? He seems virtuous and\nfrank, and tells us he is unhappy", "Are those circumstances that\nauthorise us to make a property of him? How are we entitled to his\nconfidence?\u201d\n\n\u201cLord, Madam! how little you know of love!\u201d replied Bianca; \u201cwhy, lovers\nhave no pleasure equal to talking of their mistress", "\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd would you have _me_ become a peasant\u2019s confidante?\u201d said the\nPrincess", "\u201cWell, then, let me talk to him,\u201d said Bianca; \u201cthough I have the honour\nof being your Highness\u2019s maid of honour, I was not always so great", "Besides, if love levels ranks, it raises them too; I have a respect for\nany young man in love", "\u201d\n\n\u201cPeace, simpleton!\u201d said the Princess", "\u201cThough he said he was unhappy,\nit does not follow that he must be in love", "Think of all that has\nhappened to-day, and tell me if there are no misfortunes but what love\ncauses", "\u2014Stranger,\u201d resumed the Princess, \u201cif thy misfortunes have not\nbeen occasioned by thy own fault, and are within the compass of the\nPrincess Hippolita\u2019s power to redress, I will take upon me to answer that\nshe will be thy protectress", "When thou art dismissed from this castle,\nrepair to holy father Jerome, at the convent adjoining to the church of\nSt", "Nicholas, and make thy story known to him, as far as thou thinkest\nmeet", "He will not fail to inform the Princess, who is the mother of all\nthat want her assistance", "Farewell; it is not seemly for me to hold\nfarther converse with a man at this unwonted hour", "\u201d\n\n\u201cMay the saints guard thee, gracious Lady!\u201d replied the peasant; \u201cbut oh!\nif a poor and worthless stranger might presume to beg a minute\u2019s audience\nfarther; am I so happy? the casement is not shut; might I venture to\nask\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak quickly,\u201d said Matilda; \u201cthe morning dawns apace: should the\nlabourers come into the fields and perceive us\u2014What wouldst thou ask?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know not how, I know not if I dare,\u201d said the young stranger,\nfaltering; \u201cyet the humanity with which you have spoken to me\nemboldens\u2014Lady! dare I trust you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHeavens!\u201d said Matilda, \u201cwhat dost thou mean? With what wouldst thou\ntrust me? Speak boldly, if thy secret is fit to be entrusted to a\nvirtuous breast", "\u201d\n\n\u201cI would ask,\u201d said the peasant, recollecting himself, \u201cwhether what I\nhave heard from the domestics is true, that the Princess is missing from\nthe castle?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat imports it to thee to know?\u201d replied Matilda", "\u201cThy first words\nbespoke a prudent and becoming gravity", "Dost thou come hither to pry\ninto the secrets of Manfred? Adieu", "I have been mistaken in thee", "\u201d\nSaying these words she shut the casement hastily, without giving the\nyoung man time to reply", "\u201cI had acted more wisely,\u201d said the Princess to Bianca, with some\nsharpness, \u201cif I had let thee converse with this peasant; his\ninquisitiveness seems of a piece with thy own", "\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not fit for me to argue with your Highness,\u201d replied Bianca; \u201cbut\nperhaps the questions I should have put to him would have been more to\nthe purpose than those you have been pleased to ask him", "\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! no doubt,\u201d said Matilda; \u201cyou are a very discreet personage! May I\nknow what _you_ would have asked him?\u201d\n\n\u201cA bystander often sees more of the game than those that play,\u201d answered\nBianca", "\u201cDoes your Highness think, Madam, that this question about my\nLady Isabella was the result of mere curiosity? No, no, Madam, there is\nmore in it than you great folks are aware of", "Lopez told me that all the\nservants believe this young fellow contrived my Lady Isabella\u2019s escape;\nnow, pray, Madam, observe you and I both know that my Lady Isabella never\nmuch fancied the Prince your brother", "Well! he is killed just in a\ncritical minute\u2014I accuse nobody", "A helmet falls from the moon\u2014so, my\nLord, your father says; but Lopez and all the servants say that this\nyoung spark is a magician, and stole it from Alfonso\u2019s tomb\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHave done with this rhapsody of impertinence,\u201d said Matilda", "\u201cNay, Madam, as you please,\u201d cried Bianca; \u201cyet it is very particular\nthough, that my Lady Isabella should be missing the very same day, and\nthat this young sorcerer should be found at the mouth of the trap-door", "I accuse nobody; but if my young Lord came honestly by his death\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDare not on thy duty,\u201d said Matilda, \u201cto breathe a suspicion on the\npurity of my dear Isabella\u2019s fame", "\u201d\n\n\u201cPurity, or not purity,\u201d said Bianca, \u201cgone she is\u2014a stranger is found\nthat nobody knows; you question him yourself; he tells you he is in love,\nor unhappy, it is the same thing\u2014nay, he owned he was unhappy about\nothers; and is anybody unhappy about another, unless they are in love\nwith them? and at the very next word, he asks innocently, pour soul! if\nmy Lady Isabella is missing", "\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be sure,\u201d said Matilda, \u201cthy observations are not totally without\nfoundation\u2014Isabella\u2019s flight amazes me", "The curiosity of the stranger is\nvery particular; yet Isabella never concealed a thought from me", "\u201d\n\n\u201cSo she told you,\u201d said Bianca, \u201cto fish out your secrets; but who knows,\nMadam, but this stranger may be some Prince in disguise? Do, Madam, let\nme open the window, and ask him a few questions", "\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Matilda, \u201cI will ask him myself, if he knows aught of\nIsabella; he is not worthy I should converse farther with him", "\u201d She was\ngoing to open the casement, when they heard the bell ring at the\npostern-gate of the castle, which is on the right hand of the tower,\nwhere Matilda lay", "This prevented the Princess from renewing the\nconversation with the stranger", "After continuing silent for some time, \u201cI am persuaded,\u201d said she to\nBianca, \u201cthat whatever be the cause of Isabella\u2019s flight it had no\nunworthy motive", "If this stranger was accessory to it, she must be\nsatisfied with his fidelity and worth", "I observed, did not you, Bianca?\nthat his words were tinctured with an uncommon infusion of piety", "It was\nno ruffian\u2019s speech; his phrases were becoming a man of gentle birth", "\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you, Madam,\u201d said Bianca, \u201cthat I was sure he was some Prince in\ndisguise", "\u201d\n\n\u201cYet,\u201d said Matilda, \u201cif he was privy to her escape, how will you account\nfor his not accompanying her in her flight? why expose himself\nunnecessarily and rashly to my father\u2019s resentment?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for that, Madam,\u201d replied she, \u201cif he could get from under the\nhelmet, he will find ways of eluding your father\u2019s anger", "I do not doubt\nbut he has some talisman or other about him", "\u201d\n\n\u201cYou resolve everything into magic,\u201d said Matilda; \u201cbut a man who has any\nintercourse with infernal spirits, does not dare to make use of those\ntremendous and holy words which he uttered", "Didst thou not observe with\nwhat fervour he vowed to remember _me_ to heaven in his prayers? Yes;\nIsabella was undoubtedly convinced of his piety", "\u201d\n\n\u201cCommend me to the piety of a young fellow and a damsel that consult to\nelope!\u201d said Bianca", "\u201cNo, no, Madam, my Lady Isabella is of another\nguess mould than you take her for", "She used indeed to sigh and lift up\nher eyes in your company, because she knows you are a saint; but when\nyour back was turned\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wrong her,\u201d said Matilda; \u201cIsabella is no hypocrite; she has a due\nsense of devotion, but never affected a call she has not", "On the\ncontrary, she always combated my inclination for the cloister; and though\nI own the mystery she has made to me of her flight confounds me; though\nit seems inconsistent with the friendship between us; I cannot forget the\ndisinterested warmth with which she always opposed my taking the veil", "She wished to see me married, though my dower would have been a loss to\nher and my brother\u2019s children", "For her sake I will believe well of this\nyoung peasant", "\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you do think there is some liking between them,\u201d said Bianca", "While she was speaking, a servant came hastily into the chamber and told\nthe Princess that the Lady Isabella was found", "\u201cWhere?\u201d said Matilda", "\u201cShe has taken sanctuary in St", "Nicholas\u2019s church,\u201d replied the servant;\n\u201cFather Jerome has brought the news himself;

# The Compile Inn
Well, I started this website when I realized I could conveniently host one on Github for free. It allowed me to code just a bit too, when afterwork at night, I was too tired to do anything more intellectually demanding. 

Along the way on the Internet, I found some wonderful personal websites, full of everything and its opposite. Just like that drawer in your desk or that constantly on the brink of implosion shelf in your room. This place is an hommage to these websites; my dear little *bazaar* - I love that word - a space made of loosely related things that I am willing to share online.

## Things to come
Maybe more bread calculators, maybe a JavaScript version of my drunk wizard hearsay generator to echo the one in my Dragon Arm Keep passwords play-app, I made a long time ago. 

To add:
* password generator to go with the hearsay one
* more corpuses for fun
* logorrhea with something like setInterval(getHearsay, 1000);

# The Compile Inn

Well, I started this website when I realized I could host one on Github for free. This is very convenient. It allowed me to code just a bit too, when afterwork at night, I was too tired to do anything more demanding. 

Along the way on the Internet, I found some interesting personal websites, full of everything and its opposite like that drawer in your desk, that alway on the brink of imploding shelf in your room. So this place is an hommage to these websites; my dear little *bazaar* - I love that word - a space full of personal and loosely related things that I am willing to share online.

## Things to come
Maybe more bread calculators, maybe a JavaScript version of my drunk wizard hearsay generator to echo the one in my Dragon Arm Keep passwords play-app, I made a long time ago.

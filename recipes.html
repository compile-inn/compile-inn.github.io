    <p>Notes: put the sourdough recipe from the old french book. The janots and the bretzels and fouace.</p>

    <h3>Sourdough Bread</h3>
    <p>Let's see if I can remember.<br> 
        <ul>
            <li>Hard sourdough: 150 g</li>
            <li>Flour: 500 g</li>
            <li>Salt: approx. 10 g (18 g fo 1 kg of flour is recommended)</li>
            <li>Water: approx. 80% (counting the four in the sourdough)</li>
            <li>Autolyse: 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Fermentation: 4-5 hours</li>
        </ul>    
        Since it is a very hydrated Lodève style bread, I only make one fermentation. 
        When the dough is ready, cut it if needed, put it in a slight shape you fancy and bake it directly.
        I spread flour on the table, put the dough on it, 
        cut it in half length-wise and twist the dough into a "pain tordu". 
        The twisting of the dough helps the bread to retain a slight shape and also gathers flour on its surface.
        It should be noted that during fermentation, 
        I fold the dough maybe two or three times to give it enough strengh regardless of the high hydratation.
        I cut the dough in two because I get better results this way, given the size of my oven. 
        The bread rises better and the crust is crunchier and blacker. 
        But this is a matter of taste at best: <em>de gustibus non disputandum est</em>.
    </p>
    <h4>Fermentation</h3>
    <p>I should note that usually sourdough bread does not rise as much as commercial yeast. 
       So judging the readiness of the dough by it size might not be the best 
       as you could end up with an overfermented dough just because it was not "risen" enough.
       There are other indicators, such as the texture of the dough, its surface appearance (shiny is good). 
       You can also apply a small pressure with your finger. If it bounces back to immediatly it is too soon. 
       If it does not rise back it is too late. I like to smell the dough too; does it smells good? Is it too sour?
       Remember: even if the dough has not risen a lot (like double), 
       it might be ready and rise very nicely in the oven. 
       Especially if you cut the dough into smaller pieces of bread, as the heat would be better transmitted.

    <h4>Notes on sourdough</h3>
    <p>I keep mine in the fridge, to keep it from fermenting itself to extinction. 
       One or two days before making bread, I take a little bit and refresh it several times by first adding water and then flour. 
       There should enough flour added each time, so there is room for the sourdough to develop and spread.
       To limit the acidity of the sourdough, I refresh it with a small fraction of what I need for the bread. 
       The sourdough kept in the fridge should be refreshed frequently too. 
       I am not sure how often would be good enough.
       A well fed sourdough helps it from turning too sour. 
       Et voilà! By the way, don't forget to give a name to your sourdough! It is traditional to do so (and cute). 
       Mine is called Beregost, after the city in the first Baldur's Gate game.

    <h3>Janots</h3>
    Ingredients:
    <ul>
        <li>flour: 250 g</li>
        <li>water: 125 g</li>
        <li>salt: 4.5 g</li>
        <li>sugar: 15 g</li>
        <li>levure: 2 g</li>
        <li>anis seeds: 15 g</li>
    </ul>
    How to:<br>
    Let the anis seeds infuse in the water to extract more flavor. Do not mix the yeast the salt directly as it kills it.
    Spread the dough in little circles and fold them in small triangles. Immerse them in boiling water until they reach its surface.
    Take them out, let them dry on a grid a bit then bake them in the oven.

    <h3>Anis bread</h3>
    Ingredients:
    <ul>
        <li>oil: 1 spoon</li>
        <li>flour: 250 g</li>
        <li>milk: 150 g</li>
        <li>salt: 5 g</li>
        <li>yeast: enough</li>
        <li>anis seeds: enough</li>
        <li>sugar or honey: optional</li>
    </ul>
    How to: again do not mix salt and yeast directly. When the dough is fermented enough, shape the bread - braid is nice - and bake it the oven.
    For cosmetics, you can wash the dough with milk or a mix of egg yolks and water once the bread is shaped. Let it rise almost to its maximum and then bake it.

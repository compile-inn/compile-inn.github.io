        <li><a href="/hearsay/wizard.html"></a>Hearsay generator</li>
            <p>Listen to a hearsay from the Compile inn's wizard!<br> 
                The first program I wrote was a console-based password generator. Designed I bit like an adventure game (very loosely),
                You would enter rooms in a keep called the Dragon Arm. The dragon would give you a <i>spell</i> - meaning secure passwords based on your settings, 
                The wizard would give you a <i>hearsay</i> - i.e. a passphrase composed of several random words picked from a corpus, which was based on King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.
                It takes a corpus and returns a string of randomly selected words.
                More often than not, the result is pretty humourous.
                I do not remember where I got the ASCII art from, but it is very cute.</p>
        <li><a href="vocabulary.html">EN-JP Vocabulary for CS</a></li>
            <p>A somewhat incomplete and unordered english-japanese vocabulary for computer science. I might create categories for better accessibility later if the number of entries grows to much.</p>
        <li>thesis</li>
            <p>I will try to clean the sepulcra of my thesis and extract from it the main ideas and concepts 
       I developped for my analysis of urban spaces.</p>
        <li>counterpoint rules</li>
            <p>I will try to gather here, the different rules of counterpoint. Wait, that might be way too much.</p>

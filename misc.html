            <p>Listen to a hearsay from the Compile inn's wizard! 
                This function takes a corpus and returns a string of randomly selected words. 
                More often than not, the result is pretty humourous. 
                It originates from a console based password generator I wrote. This function was to create passphrases based on King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, 
                instead of the usual mix of letter-number-special-characters for passwords. 
                I do not remember where I got the ASCII art from, but it is very cute.</p>
        <li><a href="vocabulary.html">EN-JP Vocabulary for CS</a></li>
            <p>A somewhat incomplete and unordered english-japanese vocabulary for computer science. I might create categories for better accessibility later if the number of entries grows to much.</p>
        <li>thesis</li>
            <p>I will try to clean the sepulcra of my thesis and extract from it the main ideas and concepts 
       I developped for my analysis of urban spaces.</p>
        <li>counterpoint rules</li>
            <p>I will try to gather here, the different rules of counterpoint. Wait, that might be way too much.</p>

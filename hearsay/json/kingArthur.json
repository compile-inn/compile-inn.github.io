["\ufeff                                 KING ARTHUR\n\n                     _and the Knights of the Round Table_\nKING ARTHUR AND THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE\n\n\n\nTHE COMING OF ARTHUR AND THE FOUNDING OF THE ROUND TABLE\n\n\nI\n\nMERLIN FORETELLS THE BIRTH OF ARTHUR\n\n\nKing Vortigern the usurper sat upon his throne in London, when,\nsuddenly, upon a certain day, ran in a breathless messenger, and cried\naloud--\n\n\"Arise, Lord King, for the enemy is come; even Ambrosius and Uther, upon\nwhose throne thou sittest--and full twenty thousand with them--and they\nhave sworn by a great oath, Lord, to slay thee, ere this year be done;\nand even now they march towards thee as the north wind of winter for\nbitterness and haste", "\"\n\nAt those words Vortigern's face grew white as ashes, and, rising in\nconfusion and disorder, he sent for all the best artificers and\ncraftsmen and mechanics, and commanded them vehemently to go and build\nhim straightway in the furthest west of his lands a great and strong\ncastle, where he might fly for refuge and escape the vengeance of his\nmaster's sons--\"and, moreover,\" cried he, \"let the work be done within a\nhundred days from now, or I will surely spare no life amongst you all", "\"\n\nThen all the host of craftsmen, fearing for their lives, found out a\nproper site whereon to build the tower, and eagerly began to lay in the\nfoundations", "But no sooner were the walls raised up above the ground\nthan all their work was overwhelmed and broken down by night invisibly,\nno man perceiving how, or by whom, or what", "And the same thing happening\nagain, and yet again, all the workmen, full of terror, sought out the\nking, and threw themselves upon their faces before him, beseeching him\nto interfere and help them or to deliver them from their dreadful work", "Filled with mixed rage and fear, the king called for the astrologers and\nwizards, and took counsel with them what these things might be, and how\nto overcome them", "The wizards worked their spells and incantations, and\nin the end declared that nothing but the blood of a youth born without\nmortal father, smeared on the foundations of the castle, could avail to\nmake it stand", "Messengers were therefore sent forthwith through all the\nland to find, if it were possible, such a child", "And, as some of them\nwent down a certain village street, they saw a band of lads fighting and\nquarreling, and heard them shout at one--\"Avaunt, thou imp!--avaunt! Son\nof no mortal man! go, find thy father, and leave us in peace", "\"\n\nAt that the messengers looked steadfastly on the lad, and asked who he\nwas", "One said his name was Merlin; another, that his birth and parentage\nwere known by no man; a third, that the foul fiend alone was his father", "Hearing the things, the officers seized Merlin, and carried him before\nthe king by force", "But no sooner was he brought to him than he asked in a loud voice, for\nwhat cause he was thus dragged there?\n\n\"My magicians,\" answered Vortigern, \"told me to seek out a man that had\nno human father, and to sprinkle my castle with his blood, that it may\nstand", "\"\n\n\"Order those magicians,\" said Merlin, \"to come before me, and I will\nconvict them of a lie", "\"\n\nThe king was astonished at his words, but commanded the magicians to\ncome and sit down before Merlin, who cried to them--\n\n\"Because ye know not what it is that hinders the foundation of the\ncastle, ye have advised my blood for a cement to it, as if that would\navail; but tell me now rather what there is below that ground, for\nsomething there is surely underneath that will not suffer the tower to\nstand?\"\n\nThe wizards at these words began to fear, and made no answer", "Then said\nMerlin to the king--\n\n\"I pray, Lord, that workmen may be ordered to dig deep down into the\nground till they shall come to a great pool of water", "\"\n\nThis then was done, and the pool discovered far beneath the surface of\nthe ground", "Then, turning again to the magicians, Merlin said, \"Tell me now, false\nsycophants, what there is underneath that pool?\"--but they were silent", "Then said he to the king, \"Command this pool to be drained, and at the\nbottom shall be found two dragons, great and huge, which now are\nsleeping, but which at night awake and fight and tear each other", "At\ntheir great struggle all the ground shakes and trembles, and so casts\ndown thy towers, which, therefore, never yet could find secure\nfoundations", "\"\n\nThe king was amazed at these words, but commanded the pool to be\nforthwith drained; and surely at the bottom of it did they presently\ndiscover the two dragons, fast asleep, as Merlin had declared", "But Vortigern sat upon the brink of the pool till night to see what else\nwould happen", "Then those two dragons, one of which was white, the other red, rose up\nand came near one another, and began a sore fight, and cast forth fire\nwith their breath", "But the white dragon had the advantage, and chased\nthe other to the end of the lake", "And he, for grief at his flight,\nturned back upon his foe, and renewed the combat, and forced him to\nretire in turn", "But in the end the red dragon was worsted, and the white\ndragon disappeared no man knew where", "When their battle was done, the king desired Merlin to tell him what it\nmeant", "Whereat he, bursting into tears, cried out this prophecy, which\nfirst foretold the coming of King Arthur", "\"Woe to the red dragon, which figureth the British nation, for his\nbanishment cometh quickly; his lurking-holes shall be seized by the\nwhite dragon--the Saxon whom thou, O king, hast called to the land", "The\nmountains shall be leveled as the valleys, and the rivers of the valleys\nshall run blood; cities shall be burned, and churches laid in ruins;\ntill at length the oppressed shall turn for a season and prevail against\nthe strangers", "For a Boar of Cornwall shall arise and rend them, and\ntrample their necks beneath his feet", "The island shall be subject to his\npower, and he shall take the forests of Gaul", "The house of Romulus shall\ndread him--all the world shall fear him--and his end shall no man know;\nhe shall be immortal in the mouths of the people, and his works shall be\nfood to those that tell them", "\"But as for thee, O Vortigern, flee thou the sons of Constantine, for\nthey shall burn thee in thy tower", "For thine own ruin wast thou traitor\nto their father, and didst bring the Saxon heathens to the land", "Aurelius and Uther are even now upon thee to revenge their father's\nmurder; and the brood of the white dragon shall waste thy country, and\nshall lick thy blood", "Find out some refuge, if thou wilt! but who may\nescape the doom of God?\"\n\nThe king heard all this, trembling greatly; and, convicted of his sins,\nsaid nothing in reply", "Only he hasted the builders of his tower by day\nand night, and rested not till he had fled thereto", "In the meantime, Aurelius, the rightful king, was hailed with joy by the\nBritons, who flocked to his standard, and prayed to be led against the\nSaxons", "But he, till he had first killed Vortigern, would begin no other\nwar", "He marched therefore to Cambria, and came before the tower which\nthe usurper had built", "Then, crying out to all his knights, \"Avenge ye\non him who hath ruined Britain and slain my father and your king!\" he\nrushed with many thousands at the castle walls", "But, being driven back\nagain and yet again, at length he thought of fire, and ordered blazing\nbrands to be cast into the building from all sides", "These, finding soon\na proper fuel, ceased not to rage till, spreading to a mighty\nconflagration, they burned down the tower, and Vortigern within it", "Then did Aurelius turn his strength against Hengist and the Saxons, and,\ndefeating them in many places, weakened their power for a long season,\nso that the land had peace", "Anon the king, making journeys to and fro, restoring ruined churches\nand, creating order, came to the monastery near Salisbury, where all\nthose British knights lay buried who had been slain there by the\ntreachery of Hengist", "For when in former times Hengist had made a solemn\ntruce with Vortigern, to meet in peace and settle terms, whereby himself\nand all his Saxons should depart from Britain, the Saxon soldiers\ncarried every one of them beneath his garment a long dagger, and, at a\ngiven signal, fell upon the Britons, and slew them, to the number of\nnearly five hundred", "The sight of the place where the dead lay moved Aurelius to great\nsorrow, and he cast about in his mind how to make a worthy tomb over so\nmany noble martyrs, who had died there for their country", "When he had in vain consulted many craftsmen and builders, he sent, by\nthe advice of the archbishop, for Merlin, and asked him what to do", "\"If\nyou would honor the burying-place of these men,\" said Merlin, \"with an\neverlasting monument, send for the Giants' Dance which is in Killaraus,\na mountain; in Ireland; for there is a structure of stone there which\nnone of this age could raise without a perfect knowledge of the arts", "They are stones of a vast size and wondrous nature, and if they can be\nplaced here as they are there, round this spot of ground, they will\nstand for ever", "\"\n\nAt these words of Merlin, Aurelius burst into laughter, and said, \"How\nis it possible to remove such vast stones from so great a distance, as\nif Britain, also, had no stones fit for the work?\"\n\n\"I pray the king,\" said Merlin, \"to forbear vain laughter; what I have\nsaid is true, for those stones are mystical and have healing virtues", "The giants of old brought them from the furthest coast of Africa, and\nplaced them in Ireland while they lived in that country: and their\ndesign was to make baths in them, for use in time of grievous illness", "For if they washed the stones and put the sick into the water, it\ncertainly healed them, as also it did them that were wounded in battle;\nand there is no stone among them but hath the same virtue still", "\"\n\nWhen the Britons heard this, they resolved to send for the stones, and\nto make war upon the people of Ireland if they offered to withhold them", "So, when they had chosen Uther the king's brother for their chief, they\nset sail, to the number of 15,000 men, and came to Ireland", "There\nGillomanius, the king, withstood them fiercely, and not till after a\ngreat battle could they approach the Giants' Dance, the sight of which\nfilled them with joy and admiration", "But when they sought to move the\nstones, the strength of all the army was in vain, until Merlin,\nlaughing at their failures, contrived machines of wondrous cunning,\nwhich took them down with ease, and placed them in the ships", "When they had brought the whole to Salisbury, Aurelius, with the crown\nupon his head, kept for four days the feast of Pentecost with royal\npomp; and in the midst of all the clergy and the people, Merlin raised\nup the stones, and set them round the sepulcher of the knights and\nbarons, as they stood in the mountains of Ireland", "Then was the monument called \"Stonehenge,\" and stands, as all men know,\nupon the plain of Salisbury to this very day", "Soon thereafter it befell that Aurelius was slain by poison at\nWinchester, and was himself buried within the Giants' Dance", "At the same time came forth a comet of amazing size and brightness,\ndarting out a beam, at the end whereof was a cloud of fire shaped like a\ndragon, from whose mouth went out two rays, one stretching over Gaul,\nthe other ending in seven lesser rays over the Irish sea", "At the appearance of this star a great dread fell upon the people, and\nUther, marching into Cambria against the son of Vortigern, himself was\nvery troubled to learn what it might mean", "Then Merlin, being called\nbefore him, cried with a loud voice: \"O mighty loss! O stricken Britain!\nAlas! the great prince is gone from us", "Aurelius Ambrosius is dead,\nwhose death will be ours also, unless God help us", "Haste, therefore,\nnoble Uther, to destroy the enemy; the victory shall be thine, and thou\nshalt be king of all Britain", "For the star with the fiery dragon\nsignifies thyself; and the ray over Gaul portends that thou shalt have a\nson, most mighty, whom all those kingdoms shall obey which the ray\ncovers", "\"\n\nThus, for the second time, did Merlin foretell the coming of King\nArthur", "And Uther, when he was made king, remembered Merlin's words, and\ncaused two dragons to be made in gold, in likeness of the dragon he had\nseen in the star", "One of these he gave to Winchester Cathedral, and had\nthe other carried into all his wars before him, whence he was ever after\ncalled Uther Pendragon, or the dragon's head", "Now, when Uther Pendragon had passed through all the land, and settled\nit--and even voyaged into all the countries of the Scots, and tamed the\nfierceness of that rebel people--he came to London, and ministered\njustice there", "And it befell at a certain great banquet and high feast\nwhich the king made at Easter-tide, there came, with many other earls\nand barons, Gorlo\u00efs, Duke of Cornwall, and his wife Igerna, who was the\nmost famous beauty in all Britain", "And soon thereafter, Gorlo\u00efs being\nslain in battle, Uther determined to make Igerna his own wife", "But in\norder to do this, and enable him to come to her--for she was shut up in\nthe high castle of Tintagil, on the furthest coast of Cornwall--the king\nsent for Merlin, to take counsel with him and to pray his help", "This,\ntherefore, Merlin promised him on one condition--namely, that the king\nshould give him up the first son born of the marriage", "For Merlin by\nhis art foreknew that this firstborn should be the long-wished prince,\nKing Arthur", "When Uther, therefore, was at length happily wedded, Merlin came to the\ncastle on a certain day, and said, \"Sir, thou must now provide thee for\nthe nourishing of thy child", "\"\n\nAnd the king, nothing doubting, said, \"Be it as thou wilt", "\"\n\n\"I know a lord of thine in this land,\" said Merlin, \"who is a man both\ntrue and faithful; let him have the nourishing of the child", "His name is\nSir Ector, and he hath fair possessions both in England and in Wales", "When, therefore, the child is born, let him be delivered unto me,\nunchristened, at yonder postern-gate, and I will bestow him in the care\nof this good knight", "\"\n\nSo when the child was born, the king bid two knights and two ladies to\ntake it, bound in rich cloth of gold, and deliver it to a poor man whom\nthey should discover at the postern-gate", "And the child being delivered\nthus to Merlin, who himself took the guise of a poor man, was carried by\nhim to a holy priest and christened by the name of Arthur, and then was\ntaken to Sir Ector's house, and nourished at Sir Ector's wife's own\nbreasts", "And in the same house he remained privily for many years, no\nman soever knowing where he was, save Merlin and the king", "Anon it befell that the king was seized by a lingering distemper, and\nthe Saxon heathens, taking their occasion, came back from over sea, and\nswarmed upon the land, wasting it with fire and sword", "When Uther heard\nthereof, he fell into a greater rage than his weakness could bear, and\ncommanded all his nobles to come before him, that he might upbraid them\nfor their cowardice", "And when he had sharply and hotly rebuked them, he\nswore that he himself, nigh unto death although he lay, would lead them\nforth against the enemy", "Then causing a horse-litter to be made, in\nwhich he might be carried--for he was too faint and weak to ride--he\nwent up with all his army swiftly against the Saxons", "But they, when they heard that Uther was coming in a litter, disdained\nto fight him, saying it would be shame for brave men to fight with one\nhalf dead", "So they retired into their city; and, as it were in scorn of\ndanger, left the gates wide open", "But Uther straightway commanding his\nmen to assault the town, they did so without loss of time, and had\nalready reached the gates, when the Saxons, repenting too late of their\nhaughty pride, rushed forth to the defense", "The battle raged till night,\nand was begun again next day; but at last, their leaders, Octa and Eosa,\nbeing slain, the Saxons turned their backs and fled, leaving the Britons\na full triumph", "The king at this felt so great joy, that, whereas before he could scarce\nraise himself without help, he now sat upright in his litter by himself,\nand said, with a laughing and merry face, \"They called me the half-dead\nking, and so indeed I was; but victory to me half dead is better than\ndefeat and the best health", "For to die with honor is far better than to\nlive disgraced", "\"\n\nBut the Saxons, although thus defeated, were ready still for war", "Uther\nwould have pursued them; but his illness had by now so grown, that his\nknights and barons kept him from the adventure", "Whereat the enemy took\ncourage, and left nothing undone to destroy the land; until, descending\nto the vilest treachery, they resolved to kill the king by poison", "To this end, as he lay sick at Verulum, they sent and poisoned\nstealthily a spring of clear water, whence he was wont to drink daily;\nand so, on the very next day, he was taken with the pains of death, as\nwere also a hundred others after him, before the villainy was\ndiscovered, and heaps of earth thrown over the well", "The knights and barons, full of sorrow, now took counsel together, and\ncame to Merlin for his help to learn the king's will before he died, for\nhe was by this time speechless", "\"Sirs, there is no remedy,\" said Merlin,\n\"and God's will must be done; but be ye all to-morrow before him, for\nGod will make him speak before he die", "\"\n\nSo on the morrow all the barons, with Merlin, stood round the bedside of\nthe king; and Merlin said aloud to Uther, \"Lord, shall thy son Arthur be\nthe king of all this realm after thy days?\"\n\nThen Uther Pendragon turned him about, and said, in the hearing of them\nall, \"God's blessing and mine be upon him", "I bid him pray for my soul,\nand also that he claim my crown, or forfeit all my blessing;\" and with\nthose words he died", "Then came together all the bishops and the clergy, and great multitudes\nof people, and bewailed the king; and carrying his body to the convent\nof Ambrius, they buried it close by his brother's grave, within the\n\"Giants' Dance", "\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE CROWNING OF ARTHUR AND THE SWORD EXCALIBUR\n\n\nNow Arthur the prince had all this time been nourished in Sir Ector's\nhouse as his own son, and was fair and tall and comely, being of the age\nof fifteen years, great in strength, gentle in manner, and accomplished\nin all exercises proper for the training of a knight", "But as yet he knew not of his father; for Merlin had so dealt, that none\nsave Uther and himself knew aught about him", "Wherefore it befell that\nmany of the knights and barons who heard King Uther speak before his\ndeath, and call his son Arthur his successor, were in great amazement;\nand some doubted, and others were displeased", "Anon the chief lords and princes set forth each to his own land, and,\nraising armed men and multitudes of followers, determined every one to\ngain the crown for himself; for they said in their hearts, \"If there be\nany such a son at all as he of whom this wizard forced the king to\nspeak, who are we that a beardless boy should have rule over us?\"\n\nSo the land stood long in great peril, for every lord and baron sought\nbut his own advantage; and the Saxons, growing ever more adventurous,\nwasted and overran the towns and villages in every part", "Then Merlin went to Brice, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and advised him\nto require all the earls and barons of the realm and all knights and\ngentlemen-at-arms to come to him at London, before Christmas, under pain\nof cursing, that they might learn the will of Heaven who should be king", "This, therefore, the archbishop did, and upon Christmas Eve were met\ntogether in London all the greatest princes, lords, and barons; and long\nbefore day they prayed in St", "Paul's Church, and the archbishop besought\nHeaven for a sign who should be lawful king of all the realm", "And as they prayed, there was seen in the churchyard, set straight\nbefore the doorways of the church, a huge square stone having a naked\nsword stuck in the midst of it", "And on the sword was written in letters\nof gold, \"Whoso pulleth out the sword from this stone is born the\nrightful King of England", "\"\n\nAt this all the people wondered greatly; and, when Mass was over, the\nnobles, knights, and princes ran out eagerly from the church to see the\nstone and sword; and a law was forthwith made that whoso should pull out\nthe sword should be acknowledged straightway King of Britain", "Then many knights and barons pulled at the sword with all their might,\nand some of them tried many times, but none could stir or move it", "When all had tried in vain, the archbishop declared the man whom Heaven\nhad chosen was not yet there", "\"But God,\" said he, \"will doubtless make\nhim known ere many days", "\"\n\nSo ten knights were chosen, being men of high renown, to watch and keep\nthe sword; and there was proclamation made through all the land that\nwhosoever would, had leave and liberty to try and pull it from the\nstone", "But though great multitudes of people came, both gentle and\nsimple, for many days, no man could ever move the sword a hair's breadth\nfrom its place", "Now, at the New Year's Eve a great tournament was to be held in London,\nwhich the archbishop had devised to keep together lords and commons,\nlest they should grow estranged in the troublous and unsettled times", "To\nthe which tournament there came, with many other knights, Sir Ector,\nArthur's foster-father, who had great possessions near to London; and\nwith him came his son, Sir Key, but recently made knight, to take his\npart in the jousting, and young Arthur also to witness all the sports\nand fighting", "But as they rode towards the jousts, Sir Key found suddenly he had no\nsword, for he had left it at his father's house; and turning to young\nArthur, he prayed him to ride back and fetch it for him", "\"I will with a\ngood will,\" said Arthur; and rode fast back after the sword", "But when he came to the house he found it locked and empty, for all were\ngone forth to see the tournament", "Whereat, being angry and impatient, he\nsaid within himself, \"I will ride to the churchyard and take with me\nthe sword that sticketh in the stone, for my brother shall not go\nwithout a sword this day", "\"\n\nSo he rode and came to the churchyard, and alighting from his horse he\ntied him to the gate, and went to the pavilion, which was pitched near\nthe stone, wherein abode the ten knights who watched and kept it; but he\nfound no knights there, for all were gone to see the jousting", "Then he took the sword by its handle, and lightly and fiercely he pulled\nit out of the stone, and took his horse and rode until he came to Sir\nKey and delivered him the sword", "But as soon as Sir Key saw it he knew\nwell it was the sword of the stone, and, riding swiftly to his father,\nhe cried out, \"Lo! here, sir, is the sword of the stone, wherefore it is\nI who must be king of all this land", "\"\n\nWhen Sir Ector saw the sword, he turned back straight with Arthur and\nSir Key and came to the churchyard, and there alighting, they went all\nthree into the church, and Sir Key was sworn to tell truly how he came\nby the sword", "Then he confessed it was his brother Arthur who had\nbrought it to him", "Whereat Sir Ector, turning to young Arthur, asked him--\"How gottest thou\nthe sword?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"I will tell you", "When I went home to fetch my brother's\nsword, I found nobody to deliver it to me, for all were abroad to the\njousts", "Yet was I loth to leave my brother swordless, and, bethinking me\nof this one, I came hither eagerly to fetch it for him, and pulled it\nout of the stone without any pain", "\"\n\nThen said Sir Ector, much amazed and looking steadfastly on Arthur, \"If\nthis indeed be thus, 'tis thou who shalt be king of all this land--and\nGod will have it so--for none but he who should be rightful Lord of\nBritain might ever draw this sword forth from that stone", "But let me now\nwith mine own eyes see thee put back the sword into its place and draw\nit forth again", "\"\n\n\"That is no mastery,\" said Arthur; and straightway set it in the stone", "And then Sir Ector pulled at it himself, and after him Sir Key, with all\nhis might, but both of them in vain: then Arthur, reaching forth his\nhand and grasping at the pommel, pulled it out easily, and at once", "Then fell Sir Ector down upon his knees upon the ground before young\nArthur, and Sir Key also with him, and straightway did him homage as\ntheir sovereign lord", "But Arthur cried aloud, \"Alas! mine own dear father and my brother, why\nkneel ye thus to me?\"\n\n\"Nay, my Lord Arthur,\" answered then Sir Ector, \"we are of no\nblood-kinship with thee, and little though I thought how high thy kin\nmight be, yet wast thou never more than foster-child of mine", "\" And then\nhe told him all he knew about his infancy, and how a stranger had\ndelivered him, with a great sum of gold, into his hands to be brought up\nand nourished as his own born child, and then had disappeared", "But when young Arthur heard of it, he fell upon Sir Ector's neck, and\nwept, and made great lamentation, \"For now,\" said he, \"I have in one\nday lost my father and my mother and my brother", "\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Sir Ector presently, \"when thou shalt be made king be good\nand gracious unto me and mine", "\"\n\n\"If not,\" said Arthur, \"I were no true man's son at all, for thou art he\nin all the world to whom I owe the most; and my good lady and mother,\nthy wife, hath ever kept and fostered me as though I were her own; so if\nit be God's will that I be king hereafter as thou sayest, desire of me\nwhatever thing thou wilt and I will do it; and God forbid that I should\nfail thee in it", "\"\n\n\"I will but pray,\" replied Sir Ector, \"that thou wilt make my son Sir\nKey, thy foster-brother, seneschal of all the lands", "\"\n\n\"That shall he be,\" said Arthur; \"and never shall another hold that\noffice, save thy son, while he and I do live", "\"\n\nAnon, they left the church and went to the archbishop to tell him that\nthe sword had been achieved", "And when he saw the sword in Arthur's hand\nhe set a day and summoned all the princes, knights, and barons to meet\nagain at St", "Paul's Church and see the will of Heaven signified", "So when\nthey came together, the sword was put back in the stone, and all tried,\nfrom the greatest to the least, to move it; but there before them all\nnot one could take it out save Arthur only", "But then befell a great confusion and dispute, for some cried out it was\nthe will of Heaven, and, \"Long live King Arthur,\" but many more were\nfull of wrath and said, \"What! would ye give the ancient scepter of this\nland unto a boy born none know how?\" And the contention growing greatly,\ntill nothing could be done to pacify their rage, the meeting was at\nlength broken up by the archbishop and adjourned till Candlemas, when\nall should meet again", "But when Candlemas was come, Arthur alone again pulled forth the sword,\nthough more than ever came to win it; and the barons, sorely vexed and\nangry, put it in delay till Easter", "But as he had sped before so he did\nat Easter, and the barons yet once more contrived delays till Pentecost", "But now the archbishop, fully seeing God's will, called together, by\nMerlin's counsel, a band of knights and gentlemen-at-arms, and set them\nabout Arthur to keep him safely till the Feast of Pentecost", "And when at\nthe feast Arthur still again alone prevailed to move the sword, the\npeople all with one accord cried out, \"Long live King Arthur! we will\nhave no more delay, nor any other king, for so it is God's will; and we\nwill slay whoso resisteth Him and Arthur;\" and wherewithal they kneeled\ndown all at once, and cried for Arthur's grace and pardon that they had\nso long delayed him from his crown", "Then he full sweetly and\nmajestically pardoned them; and taking in his hand the sword, he offered\nit upon the high altar of the church", "Anon was he solemnly knighted with great pomp by the most famous knight\nthere present, and the crown was placed upon his head; and, having\ntaken oath to all the people, lords and commons, to be true king and\ndeal in justice only unto his life's end, he received homage and service\nfrom all the barons who held lands and castles from the crown", "Then he\nmade Sir Key, High Steward of England, and Sir Badewaine of Britain,\nConstable, and Sir Ulfius, Chamberlain: and after this, with all his\ncourt and a great retinue of knights and armed men, he journeyed into\nWales, and was crowned again in the old city of Caerleon-upon-Usk", "Meanwhile those knights and barons who had so long delayed him from the\ncrown, met together and went up to the coronation feast at Caerleon, as\nif to do him homage; and there they ate and drank such things as were\nset before them at the royal banquet, sitting with the others in the\ngreat hall", "But when after the banquet Arthur began, according to the ancient royal\ncustom, to bestow great boons and fiefs on whom he would, they all with\none accord rose up, and scornfully refused his gifts, crying that they\nwould take nothing from a beardless boy come of low or unknown birth,\nbut would instead give him good gifts of hard sword-strokes between neck\nand shoulders", "Whereat arose a deadly tumult in the hall, and every man there made him\nready to fight", "But Arthur leaped up as a flame of fire against them,\nand all his knights and barons drawing their swords, rushed after him\nupon them and began a full sore battle; and presently the king's party\nprevailed, and drave the rebels from the hall and from the city, closing\nthe gates behind them; and King Arthur brake his sword upon them in his\neagerness and rage", "But amongst them were six kings of great renown and might, who more than\nall raged against Arthur and determined to destroy him, namely, King\nLot, King Nanters, King Urien, King Carados, King Yder, and King\nAnguisant", "These six, therefore, joining their armies together, laid\nclose siege to the city of Caerleon, wherefrom King Arthur had so\nshamefully driven them", "And after fifteen days Merlin came suddenly into their camp and asked\nthem what this treason meant", "Then he declared to them that Arthur was\nno base adventurer, but King Uther's son, whom they were bound to serve\nand honor even though Heaven had not vouch-safed the wondrous miracle of\nthe sword", "Some of the kings, when they heard Merlin speak thus,\nmarveled and believed him; but others, as King Lot, laughed him and his\nwords to scorn, and mocked him for a conjurer and wizard", "But it was\nagreed with Merlin that Arthur should come forth and speak with the\nkings", "So he went forth to them to the city gate, and with him the archbishop\nand Merlin, and Sir Key, Sir Brastias, and a great company of others", "And he spared them not in his speech, but spoke to them as king and\nchieftain, telling them plainly he would make them all bow to him if he\nlived, unless they choose to do him homage there and then; and so they\nparted in great wrath, and each side armed in haste", "\"What will ye do?\" said Merlin to the kings; \"ye had best hold your\nhands, for were ye ten times as many ye should not prevail", "\"\n\n\"Shall we be afraid of a dream-reader?\" quoth King Lot in scorn", "With that Merlin vanished away and came to King Arthur", "Then Arthur said to Merlin, \"I have need now of a sword that shall\nchastise these rebels terribly", "\"\n\n\"Come then with me,\" said Merlin, \"for hard by there is a sword that I\ncan gain for thee", "\"\n\nSo they rode out that night till they came to a fair and broad lake, and\nin the midst of it King Arthur saw an arm thrust up, clothed in white\nsamite, and holding a great sword in the hand", "\"Lo! yonder is the sword I spoke of,\" said Merlin", "Then saw they a damsel floating on the lake in the moonlight", "\"What\ndamsel is that?\" said the king", "\"The lady of the lake,\" said Merlin; \"for upon this lake there is a\nrock, and on the rock a noble palace, where she abideth, and she will\ncome towards thee presently, when thou shalt ask her courteously for the\nsword", "\"\n\nTherewith the damsel came to King Arthur, and saluted him, and he\nsaluted her, and said, \"Lady, what sword is that the arm holdeth above\nthe water? I would that it were mine, for I have no sword", "\"\n\n\"Sir King,\" said the lady of the lake, \"that sword is mine, and if thou\nwilt give me in return a gift whenever I shall ask it of thee, thou\nshalt have it", "\"\n\n\"By my faith,\" said he, \"I will give thee any gift that thou shalt ask", "\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the damsel, \"go into yonder barge, and row thyself unto the\nsword, and take it and the scabbard with thee, and I will ask my gift of\nthee when I see my time", "\"\n\nSo King Arthur and Merlin alighted, and tied their horses to two trees,\nand went into the barge; and when they came to the sword that the hand\nheld, King Arthur took it by the handle and bore it with him, and the\narm and hand went down under the water; and so they came back to land,\nand rode again to Caerleon", "On the morrow Merlin bade King Arthur to set fiercely on the enemy; and\nin the meanwhile three hundred good knights went over to King Arthur\nfrom the rebels' side", "Then at the spring of day, when they had scarce\nleft their tents, he fell on them with might and main, and Sir\nBadewaine, Sir Key, and Sir Brastias slew on the right and on the left\nmarvelously; and ever in the thickest of the fight King Arthur raged\nlike a young lion, and laid on with his sword, and did wondrous deeds of\narms, to the joy and admiration of the knights and barons who beheld\nhim", "Then King Lot, King Carados, and the King of the Hundred Knights--who\nalso was with them--going round to the rear, set on King Arthur fiercely\nfrom behind; but King Arthur, turning to his knights, fought ever in the\nforemost press until his horse was slain beneath him", "At that, King Lot\nrode furiously at him, and smote him down; but rising straightway, and\nbeing set again on horseback, he drew his sword Excalibur that he had\ngained by Merlin from the lady of the lake, which, shining brightly as\nthe light of thirty torches, dazzled the eyes of his enemies", "And\ntherewith falling on them afresh with all his knights, he drove them\nback and slew them in great numbers, and Merlin by his arts scattered\namong them fire and pitchy smoke, so that they broke and fled", "Then all\nthe common people of Caerleon, seeing them give way, rose up with one\naccord, and rushed at them with clubs and staves, and chased them far\nand wide, and slew many great knights and lords, and the remainder of\nthem fled and were seen no more", "Thus won King Arthur his first battle\nand put his enemies to shame", "But the six kings, though sorely routed, prepared for a new war, and\njoining to themselves five others swore together that, whether for weal\nor woe, they would keep steadfast alliance till they had destroyed King\nArthur", "Then, with a host of 50,000 men-at-arms on horseback, and 10,000\nfoot, they were soon ready, and sent forth their fore-riders, and drew\nfrom the northern country towards King Arthur, to the castle of\nBedgraine", "But he by Merlin's counsel had sent over sea to King Ban of Benwick and\nKing Bors of Gaul, praying them to come and help him in his wars, and\npromising to help them in return against King Claudas, their foe", "To\nwhich those kings made answer that they would joyfully fulfil his wish,\nand shortly after came to London with 300 knights, well arrayed for both\npeace and war, leaving behind them a great army on the other side of the\nsea till they had consulted with King Arthur and his ministers how they\nmight best dispose of it", "And Merlin being asked for his advice and help, agreed to go himself and\nfetch it over sea to England, which in one night he did; and brought\nwith him 10,000 horsemen and led them northward privately to the forest\nof Bedgraine, and there lodged them in a valley secretly", "Then, by the counsel of Merlin, when they knew which way the eleven\nkings would ride and sleep, King Arthur with Kings Ban and Bors made\nthemselves ready with their army for the fight, having yet but 30,000\nmen, counting the 10,000 who had come from Gaul", "\"Now shall ye do my advice,\" said Merlin; \"I would that King Ban and\nKing Bors, with all their fellowship of 10,000 men, were led to ambush\nin this wood ere daylight, and stir not therefrom until the battle hath\nbeen long waged", "And thou, Lord Arthur, at the spring of day draw forth\nthine army before the enemy, and dress the battle so that they may at\nonce see all thy host, for they will be the more rash and hardy when\nthey see you have but 20,000 men", "\"\n\nTo this the three knights and the barons heartily consented, and it was\ndone as Merlin had devised", "So on the morrow when the hosts beheld each\nother, the host of the north was greatly cheered to find so few led out\nagainst them", "Then gave King Arthur the command to Sir Ulfius and Sir Brastias to take\n3000 men-at-arms, and to open battle", "They therefore setting fiercely on\nthe enemy slew them on the right hand and the left till it was wonderful\nto see their slaughter", "When the eleven kings beheld so small a band doing such mighty deeds of\narms they were ashamed, and charged them fiercely in return", "Then was\nSir Ulfius' horse slain under him; but he fought well and marvelously on\nfoot against Duke Eustace and King Clarience, who set upon him\ngrievously, till Sir Brastias, seeing his great peril, pricked towards\nthem swiftly, and so smote the duke through with his spear that horse\nand man fell down and rolled over", "Whereat King Clarience turned upon\nSir Brastias, and rushing furiously together they each unhorsed the\nother and fell both to the ground, and there lay a long time stunned,\ntheir horses' knees being cut to the bone", "Then came Sir Key the\nseneschal with six companions, and did wondrous well, till the eleven\nkings went out against them and overthrew Sir Griflet and Sir Lucas the\nbutler", "And when Sir Key saw Sir Griflet unhorsed and on foot, he rode\nagainst King Nanters hotly and smote him down, and led his horse to\nGriflet and horsed him again; with the same spear did Sir Key smite down\nKing Lot and wounded him full sore", "But seeing that, the King of the Hundred Knights rushed at Sir Key and\noverthrew him in return, and took his horse and gave it to King Lot", "And when Sir Griflet saw Sir Key's mischance, he set his spear in rest,\nand riding at a mighty man-at-arms, he cast him down headlong and caught\nhis horse and led it straightway to Sir Key", "By now the battle was growing perilous and hard, and both sides fought\nwith rage and fury", "And Sir Ulfius and Sir Brastias were both afoot and\nin great danger of their death, and foully stained and trampled under\nhorses' feet", "Then King Arthur, putting spurs to his horse, rushed\nforward like a lion into the midst of all the _m\u00eal\u00e8e_, and singling out\nKing Cradlemont of North Wales, smote him through the left side and\noverthrew him, and taking his horse by the rein he brought it to Sir\nUlfius in haste and said, \"Take this horse, mine old friend, for thou\nhast great need of one, and charge by side of me", "\" And even as he spoke\nhe saw Sir Ector, Sir Key's father, smitten to the earth by the King of\nthe Hundred Knights, and his horse taken to King Cradlemont", "But when King Arthur saw him ride upon Sir Ector's horse his wrath was\nvery great, and with his sword he smote King Cradlemont upon the helm,\nand shore off the fourth part thereof and of the shield, and drave the\nsword onward to the horse's neck and slew the horse, and hurled the king\nupon the ground", "And now the battle waxed so great and furious that all the noise and\nsound thereof rang out by water and by wood, so that Kings Ban and Bors,\nwith all their knights and men-at-arms in ambush, hearing the tumult\nand the cries, trembled and shook for eagerness, and scarce could stay\nin secret, but made them ready for the fray and dressed their shields\nand harness", "But when King Arthur saw the fury of the enemy, he raged like a mad\nlion, and stirred and drove his horse now here, now there, to the right\nhand and to the left and stayed not in his wrath till he had slain full\ntwenty knights", "He wounded also King Lot so sorely in the shoulder that\nhe left the field, and in great pain and dolor cried out to the other\nkings, \"Do ye as I devise, or we shall be destroyed", "I, with the King of\nthe Hundred Knights, King Anguisant, King Yder, and the Duke of\nCambinet, will take fifteen thousand men and make a circuit, meanwhile\nthat ye do hold the battle with twelve thousand", "Then coming suddenly we\nwill fall fiercely on them from behind and put them to the rout, but\nelse shall we never stand against them", "\"\n\nSo Lot and four kings departed with their party to one side, and the six\nother kings dressed their ranks against King Arthur and fought long and\nstoutly", "But now Kings Ban and Bors, with all their army fresh and eager, broke\nfrom their ambush and met face to face the five kings and their host as\nthey came round behind, and then began a frantic struggle with breaking\nof spears and clashing of swords and slaying of men and horses", "Anon\nKing Lot, espying in the midst King Bors, cried out in great dismay,\n\"Our Lady now defend us from our death and fearful wounds; our peril\ngroweth great, for yonder cometh one of the worshipfullest kings and\nbest knights in all the world", "\"\n\n\"Who is he?\" said the King of the Hundred Knights", "\"It is King Bors of Gaul,\" replied King Lot, \"and much I marvel how he\nmay have come with all his host into this land without our knowledge", "\"\n\n\"Aha!\" cried King Carados, \"I will encounter with this king if ye will\nrescue me when there is need", "\"\n\n\"Ride on,\" said they", "So King Carados and all his host rode softly till they came within a\nbow-shot of King Bors, and then both hosts, spurring their horses to\ntheir greatest swiftness, rushed at each other", "And King Bors\nencountered in the onset with a knight, and struck him through with a\nspear, so that he fell dead upon the earth;

Therefore\nit is my counsel to put away our footmen from us, for it is almost\nnight, and King Arthur will not stay to slaughter them", "So they can save\ntheir lives in this great wood hard by", "Then let us gather into one\nband all the horsemen that remain, and whoso breaketh rank or leaveth\nus, let him be straightway slain by him that seeth him, for it is better\nthat we slay a coward than through a coward be all slain", "How say ye?\"\nsaid King Lot; \"answer me, all ye kings", "\"\n\n\"It is well said,\" replied they all", "And swearing they would never fail each other, they mended and set right\ntheir armor and their shields, and took new spears and set them\nsteadfastly against their thighs, waiting, and so stood still as a clump\nof trees stands on the plain; and no assaults could shake them, they\nheld so hard together; which when King Arthur saw he marveled greatly,\nand was very wroth", "\"Yet,\" cried he, \"I may not blame them, by my faith,\nfor they do as brave men ought to do, and are the best fighting men and\nknights of most prowess that I ever saw or heard tell of", "\" And so said\nalso Kings Ban and Bors, and praised them greatly for their noble\nchivalry", "But now came forty noble knights out of King Arthur's host, and prayed\nthat he would suffer them to break the enemy", "And when they were\nallowed, they rode forth with their spears upon their thighs, and\nspurred their horses to their hottest", "Then the eleven kings, with a\nparty of their knights, rushed with set spears as fast and mightily to\nmeet them; and when they were encountered, all the crash and splinter of\ntheir spears and armor rang with a mighty din, and so fierce and bloody\nwas their onset that in all that day there had been no such cruel press,\nand rage, and smiting", "At that same moment rode fiercely into the\nthickest of the struggle King Arthur and Kings Ban and Bors, and slew\ndownright on both hands right and left, until their horses went in blood\nup to the fetlocks", "And while the slaughter and the noise and shouting were at their\ngreatest, suddenly there came down through the battle Merlin the Wizard,\nupon a great black horse, and riding to King Arthur, he cried out,\n\"Alas, my Lord! will ye have never done? Of sixty thousand have ye left\nbut fifteen thousand men alive", "Is it not time to stay this slaying? for\nGod is ill pleased with ye that ye have never ended, and yonder kings\nshall not be altogether overthrown this time", "But if ye fall upon them\nany more, the fortune of this day will turn, and go to them", "Withdraw,\nLord, therefore, to thy lodging, and there now take thy rest, for to-day\nthou hast won a great victory, and overcome the noblest chivalry of all\nthe world", "And now for many years those kings shall not disturb thee", "Therefore, I tell thee, fear them no more, for now they are sore beaten,\nand have nothing left them but their honor; and why shouldest thou slay\nthem to take that?\"\n\nThen said King Arthur, \"Thou sayest well, and I will take thy counsel", "\"\nWith that he cried out, \"Ho!\" for the battle to cease, and sent forth\nheralds through the field to stay more fighting", "And gathering all the\nspoil, he gave it not amongst his own host, but to Kings Ban and Bors\nand all their knights and men-at-arms, that he might treat them with the\ngreater courtesy as strangers", "Then Merlin took his leave of Arthur and the two other kings, and went\nto see his master, Blaise, a holy hermit, dwelling in Northumberland,\nwho had nourished him through all his youth", "And Blaise was passing glad\nto see him, for there was a great love ever between them; and Merlin\ntold him how King Arthur had sped in the battle, and how it had ended;\nand told him the names of every king and knight of worship who was\nthere", "So Blaise wrote down the battle, word for word, as Merlin told\nhim; and in the same way ever after, all the battles of King Arthur's\ndays Merlin caused Blaise, his master, to record", "III\n\nARTHUR DRIVES THE SAXONS FROM HIS REALM\n\n\nAnon, thereafter, came word to King Arthur that Ryence, King of North\nWales, was making war upon King Leodegrance of Camelgard;

and we with\nthe riches we have won here by your gifts shall hire many good knights,\nand, by the grace of God, withstand the malice of King Claudas; and if\nwe have need we will send to ye for succor; and likewise ye, if ye have\nneed, send for us, and we will not tarry, by the faith of our bodies", "\"\n\nWhen the two kings had left, King Arthur rode to Caerleon, and thither\ncame to him his half-sister Belisent, wife to King Lot, sent as a\nmessenger, but in truth to espy his power; and with her came a noble\nretinue, and also her four sons--Gowain, Gaheris, Agravaine, and Gareth", "But when she saw King Arthur and his nobleness, and all the splendor of\nhis knights and service, she forebore to spy upon him as a foe, and told\nhim of her husband's plots against him and his throne", "And the king, not\nknowing that she was his half-sister, made great court to her; and being\nfull of admiration for her beauty, loved her out of measure, and kept\nher a long season at Caerleon", "Wherefore her husband, King Lot, was more\nthan ever King Arthur's enemy, and hated him till death with a passing\ngreat hatred", "At that time King Arthur had a marvelous dream, which gave him great\ndisquietness of heart", "He dreamed that the whole land was full of many\nfiery griffins and serpents, which burnt and slew the people everywhere;\nand then that he himself fought with them, and that they did him mighty\ninjuries, and wounded him nigh to death, but that at last he overcame\nand slew them all", "When he woke, he sat in great heaviness of spirit and\npensiveness, thinking what this dream might signify, but by-and-by, when\nhe could by no means satisfy himself what it might mean, to rid himself\nof all his thoughts of it, he made ready with a great company to ride\nout hunting", "As soon as he was in the forest, the king saw a great hart before him,\nand spurred his horse, and rode long eagerly after it, and chased until\nhis horse lost breath and fell down dead from under him", "Then, seeing\nthe hart escaped and his horse dead, he sat down by a fountain, and fell\ninto deep thought again", "And as he sat there alone, he thought he heard\nthe noise of hounds, as it were some thirty couple in number, and\nlooking up he saw coming towards him the strangest beast that ever he\nhad seen or heard tell of, which ran towards the fountain and drank of\nthe water", "Its head was like a serpent's, with a leopard's body and a\nlion's tail, and it was footed like a stag; and the noise was in its\nbelly, as it were the baying or questing of thirty couple of hounds", "While it drank there was no noise within it; but presently, having\nfinished, it departed with a greater sound than ever", "The king was amazed at all this; but being greatly wearied, he fell\nasleep, and was before long waked up by a knight on foot, who said,\n\"Knight, full of thought and sleepy, tell me if thou sawest a strange\nbeast pass this way?\"\n\n\"Such a one I saw,\" said King Arthur to the knight, \"but that is now two\nmiles distant at the least", "What would you with that beast?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the knight, \"I have followed it for a long time, and have\nkilled my horse, and would to heaven I had another to pursue my quest\nwithal", "\"\n\nAt that moment came a yeoman with another horse for the king, which,\nwhen the knight saw, he earnestly prayed to be given him", "\"For I have\nfollowed this quest,\" said he, \"twelve months, and either I shall\nachieve him or bleed of the best blood of my body", "\"\n\nIt was King Pellinore who at that time followed the questing beast, but\nneither he nor King Arthur knew each other", "\"Sir Knight,\" said King Arthur, \"leave that quest and suffer me to have\nit, and I will follow it other twelve months", "\"\n\n\"Ah, fool,\" said the knight, \"thy desire is utterly in vain, for it\nshall never be achieved but by me, or by my next of kin", "\"\n\nTherewith he started to the king's horse, and mounted to the saddle,\ncrying out, \"Gramercy, this horse is mine!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the king, \"thou mayest take my horse by force, and I will\nnot say nay; but till we prove whether thou or I be best on horseback, I\nshall not rest content", "\"\n\n\"Seek me here,\" said the knight, \"whenever thou wilt, and here by this\nfountain thou shalt find me;\" and so he passed forth on his way", "Then sat King Arthur in a deep fit of study, and bade his yeomen fetch\nhim yet another horse as quickly as they could", "And when they left him\nall alone came Merlin, disguised as a child of fourteen years of age,\nand saluted the king, and asked him why he was so pensive and heavy", "\"I may well be pensive and heavy,\" he replied, \"for here even now I have\nseen the strangest sight I ever saw", "\"\n\n\"That know I well,\" said Merlin, \"as well as thyself, and also all thy\nthoughts;

wherefore he shaved his head and beard, and\ndisguised himself as a jester, and so passed through King Arthur's camp,\nsinging and playing on a harp, till by degrees he drew near to the city\nwalls, where presently he made himself known, and was drawn up by ropes\ninto the town", "Anon, while Arthur closely watched the city, came news that full six\nhundred ships had landed countless swarms of Saxons, under Cheldric, on\nthe eastern coast", "At that he raised the siege, and marched straight to\nLondon, and there increased his army, and took counsel with his barons\nhow to drive the Saxons from the land for evermore", "Then with his nephew, Hoel, King of the Armorican Britons, who came with\na great force to help him, King Arthur, with a mighty multitude of\nbarons, knights, and fighting men, went swiftly up to Lincoln, which the\nSaxons lay besieging", "And there he fought a passing fierce battle, and\nmade grievous slaughter, killing above six thousand men, till the main\nbody of them turned and fled", "But he pursued them hotly into the wood of\nCelidon, where, sheltering themselves among the trees from his arrows,\nthey made a stand, and for a long season bravely defended themselves", "Anon, he ordered all the trees in that part of the forest to be cut\ndown, leaving no shelter or ambush;

\"here hadst thou been killed, despite thy\nmany crafts, had I not chanced to pass", "\"\n\n\"Not so,\" said Merlin, \"for when I would, I could have saved myself; but\nthou art nearer to thy death than I, for without special help from\nheaven thou ridest now towards thy grave", "\"\n\nAnd as they were thus talking, they came to the fountain and the rich\npavilion pitched beside it, and saw a knight sitting all armed on a\nchair in the opening of the tent", "\"Sir knight,\" said King Arthur, \"for\nwhat cause abidest thou here? to joust with any knight that passeth by?\nIf so, I caution thee to quit that custom", "\"\n\n\"That custom,\" said the knight, \"have I followed and will follow, let\nwhosoever will say nay, and if any is aggrieved at it, let him who will\namend it", "\"\n\n\"I will amend it,\" said King Arthur", "\"And I will defend it,\" answered the knight", "Then the knight mounted his horse and made himself ready, and charging\nat each other they met so hard that both their lances splintered into\npieces", "Then King Arthur drew his sword, but the knight cried out, \"Not\nso;

Fifty such men as thou were powerless to resist him", "Here\nlieth dead my lady, Duchess of Brittany, wife to Sir Hoel, who was the\nfairest lady in the world, foully and shamefully slaughtered by that\nfiend! Beware that thou go not too nigh, for he hath overcome and\nvanquished fifteen kings, and hath made himself a coat of precious\nstones, embroidered with their beards; but if thou art so hardy, and\nwilt speak with him, at yonder great fire he is at supper", "\"\n\n\"Well,\" said King Arthur, \"I will accomplish mine errand, for all thy\nfearful words;\" and so went forth to the crest of the hill, and saw\nwhere the giant sat at supper, gnawing on a limb of a man, and baking\nhis huge frame by the fire, while three damsels turned three spits,\nwhereon were spitted, like larks, twelve young children lately born", "When King Arthur saw all that, his heart bled for sorrow, and he\ntrembled for rage and indignation; then lifting up his voice he cried\naloud--\"God, that wieldeth all the world, give thee short life and\nshameful death, and may the devil have thy soul! Why hast thou slain\nthose children and that fair lady! Wherefore arise, and prepare thee to\nperish, thou glutton and fiend, for this day thou shalt die by my\nhands", "\"\n\nThen the giant, mad with fury at these words, started up, and seizing a\ngreat club, smote the king, and struck his crown from off his head", "But\nKing Arthur smote him with his sword so mightily in return, that all his\nblood gushed forth in streams", "At that the giant, howling in great anguish, threw away his club of\niron, and caught the king in both his arms and strove to crush his ribs\ntogether", "But King Arthur struggled and writhed, and twisted him about\nso that the giant could not hold him tightly; and as they fiercely\nwrestled, they both fell, and rolling over one another,\ntumbled--wrestling, and struggling, and fighting frantically--from rock\nto rock, till they came to the sea", "And as they tore and strove and tumbled, the king ever and anon smote at\nthe giant with his dagger, till his arms stiffened in death around King\nArthur's body, and groaning horribly, he died", "So presently the two\nknights came and found the king locked fast in the giant's arms, and\nvery faint and weary, and loosed him from their hold", "Then the king bade Sir Key to \"smite off the giant's head, and set it on\nthe truncheon of a spear, and bear it to Sir Hoel, and tell him that his\nenemy is slain; and afterwards let it be fastened to the castle gate,\nthat all the people may behold it", "And go ye two up on the mountain and\nfetch me my shield and sword, and also the great club of iron ye will\nsee there; and as for the treasure, ye shall find there wealth beyond\ncounting, but take as much as ye will, for I have his kirtle and the\nclub, I desire no more", "\"\n\nThen the knights fetched the club and kirtle, as the king had ordered,\nand took the treasure to themselves, as much as they could carry, and\nreturned to the army", "But when this deed was noised abroad, all the\npeople came in multitudes to thank the king, who told them \"to give\nthanks to God, and to divide the giant's spoils amongst them equally", "\"\nAnd King Arthur desired Sir Hoel to build a church upon the mount, and\ndedicate it to the Archangel Michael", "On the morrow, all the host moved onwards into the country of Champagne,\nand Flollo, the Roman tribune, retired before them into Paris", "But\nwhile he was preparing to collect more forces from the neighboring\ncountries, King Arthur came upon him unawares; and besieged him in the\ntown", "And when a month had passed, Flollo--full of grief at the starvation of\nhis people, who died in hundreds day by day--sent to King Arthur, and\ndesired that they two might fight together; for he was a man of mighty\nstature and courage, and thought himself sure of the victory", "This\nchallenge, King Arthur, full weary of the siege, accepted with great\njoy, and sent back word to Flollo that he would meet him whensoever he\nappointed", "And a truce being made on both sides, they met together the next day on\nthe island without the city, where all the people also were gathered to\nsee the issue", "And as the king and Flollo rode up to the lists, each was\nso nobly armed and horsed, and sat so mightily upon his saddle, that no\nman could tell which way the battle would end", "When they had saluted one another, and presented themselves against each\nother with their lances aloft, they put spurs to their horses and began\na fierce encounter", "But King Arthur, carrying his spear more warily,\nstruck it on the upper part of Flollo's breast, and flung him from his\nsaddle to the earth", "Then drawing his sword, he cried to him to rise,\nand rushed upon him; but Flollo, starting up, met him with his spear\ncouched, and pierced the breast of King Arthur's horse, and overthrew\nboth horse and man", "The Britons, when they saw their king upon the ground, could scarcely\nkeep themselves from breaking up the truce and falling on the Gauls", "But\nas they were about to burst the barriers, and rush upon the lists, King\nArthur hastily arose, and, guarding himself with his shield, ran with\nspeed on Flollo", "And now they renewed the assault with great rage, being\nsorely bent upon each other's death", "At length, Flollo, seizing his advantage, gave King Arthur a huge stroke\nupon the helm, which nigh overthrew him, and drew forth his blood in\nstreams", "But when King Arthur saw his armor and shield all red with blood, he was\ninflamed with fury, and lifting up Excalibur on high, with all his\nmight, he struck straight through the helmet into Flollo's head, and\nsmote it into halves; and Flollo falling backwards, and tearing up the\nground with his spurs, expired", "As soon as this news spread, the citizens all ran together, and, opening\nthe gates, surrendered the city to the conqueror", "And when he had overrun the whole province with his arms, and reduced it\neverywhere to subjection, he returned again to Britain, and held his\ncourt at Caerleon, with greater state than ever", "Anon he invited thereto all the kings, dukes, earls, and barons, who\nowed him homage, that he might treat them royally, and reconcile them to\neach other, and to his rule", "And never was there a city more fit and pleasant for such festivals", "For\non one side it was washed by a noble river, so that the kings and\nprinces from the countries beyond sea might conveniently sail up to it;\nand on the other side, the beauty of the groves and meadows, and the\nstateliness and magnificence of the royal palaces, with lofty gilded\nroofs, made it even rival the grandeur of Rome", "It was famous also for\ntwo great and noble churches, whereof one was built in honor of the\nmartyr Julius, and adorned with a choir of virgins who had devoted\nthemselves wholly to the service of God; and the other, founded in\nmemory of St", "Aaron, his companion, maintained a convent of canons, and\nwas the third metropolitan church of Britain", "Besides, there was a\ncollege of two hundred philosophers, learned in astronomy, and all the\nother sciences and arts", "In this place, therefore, full of such delights, King Arthur held his\ncourt, with many jousts and tournaments, and royal huntings, and rested\nfor a season after all his wars", "And on a certain day there came into the court a messenger from Ryence,\nKing of North Wales, bearing this message from his master: That King\nRyence had discomfited eleven kings, and had compelled each one of them\nto cut off his beard;

yet, young although I be, I owe no homage\neither to him or any man--nor will ever owe", "But, young although I be, I\nwill have thy master's homage upon both his knees before this year be\npast, or else he shall lose his head, by the faith of my body, for this\nmessage is the shamefullest I ever heard speak of", "I see well thy king\nhath never yet met with a worshipful man;

but even\nnow another knight is fighting with him to deliver the lady; ride on and\nthou shalt find them fighting still", "\"\n\nAt that King Pellinore rode swiftly on, and came to where he saw the two\nknights fighting, hard by where two pavilions stood", "And when he looked\nin one of them, he saw the lady that was his quest, and with her the two\nsquires of the two knights who fought", "\"Fair lady,\" said he, \"ye must come with me unto King Arthur's court", "\"\n\n\"Sir knight,\" said the two squires, \"yonder be two knights fighting for\nthis lady; go part them, and get their consent to take her, ere thou\ntouch her", "\"\n\n\"Ye say well,\" said King Pellinore, and rode between the combatants, and\nasked them why they fought", "\"Sir knight,\" said the one, \"yon lady is my cousin, mine aunt's\ndaughter, whom I met borne away against her will, by this knight here,\nwith whom I therefore fight to free her", "\"\n\n\"Sir knight,\" replied the other, whose name was Hantzlake of Wentland,\n\"this lady got I, by my arms and prowess, at King Arthur's court\nto-day", "\"\n\n\"That is false,\" said King Pellinore; \"ye stole the lady suddenly, and\nfled away with her, before any knight could arm to stay thee", "But it is\nmy service to take her back again", "Neither of ye shall therefore have\nher; but if ye will fight for her, fight with me now and here", "\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the knights, \"make ready, and we will assail thee with all\nour might", "\"\n\nThen Sir Hantzlake ran King Pellinore's horse through with his sword, so\nthat they might be all alike on foot", "But King Pellinore at that was\npassing wroth, and ran upon Sir Hantzlake, with a cry, \"Keep well thy\nhead!\" and gave him such a stroke upon the helm as clove him to the\nchin, so that he fell dead to the ground", "When he saw that, the other\nknight refused to fight, and kneeling down said, \"Take my cousin the\nlady with thee, as thy quest is; but as thou art a true knight, suffer\nher to come to neither shame nor harm", "\"\n\nSo the next day King Pellinore departed for Camelot, and took the lady\nwith him; and as they rode in a valley full of rough stones, the\ndamsel's horse stumbled and threw her, so that her arms were sorely\nbruised and hurt", "And as they rested in the forest for the pain to\nlessen, night came on, and there they were compelled to make their\nlodging", "A little before midnight they heard the trotting of a horse", "\"Be ye still,\" said King Pellinore, \"for now we may hear of some\nadventure,\" and therewith he armed her", "Then he heard two knights meet\nand salute each other, in the dark; one riding from Camelot, the other\nfrom the north", "\"What tidings at Camelot?\" said one", "\"By my head,\" said the other, \"I have but just left there, and have\nespied King Arthur's court, and such a fellowship is there as never may\nbe broke or overcome; for wellnigh all the chivalry of the world is\nthere, and all full loyal to the king, and now I ride back homewards to\nthe north to tell our chiefs, that they waste not their strength in wars\nagainst him", "\"\n\n\"As for all that,\" replied the other knight, \"I am but now from the\nnorth, and bear with me a remedy, the deadliest poison that ever was\nheard tell of, and to Camelot will I with it; for there we have a friend\nclose to the king, and greatly cherished of him, who hath received gifts\nfrom us to poison him, as he hath promised soon to do", "\"\n\n\"Beware,\" said the first knight, \"of Merlin, for he knoweth all things,\nby the devil's craft", "\"\n\n\"I will not fear for that,\" replied the other, and so rode on his way", "Anon King Pellinore and the lady passed on again; and when they came to\nthe well at which the lady with the wounded knight had sat, they found\nboth knight and damsel utterly devoured by lions and wild beasts, all\nsave the lady's head", "When King Pellinore saw that, he wept bitterly, saying, \"Alas! I might\nhave saved her life had I but tarried a few moments in my quest", "\"\n\n\"Wherefore make so much sorrow now?\" said the lady", "\"I know not,\" answered he, \"but my heart grieveth greatly for this poor\nlady's death, so fair she was and young", "\"\n\nThen he required a hermit to bury the remains of the bodies, and bare\nthe lady's head with him to Camelot, to the court", "When he was arrived, he was sworn to tell the truth of his quest before\nthe King and Queen, and when he had entered the Queen somewhat upbraided\nhim, saying, \"Ye were much to blame that ye saved not that lady's life", "\"\n\n\"Madam,\" said he, \"I shall repent it all my life", "\"\n\n\"Ay, king,\" quoth Merlin, who suddenly came in, \"and so ye ought to do,\nfor that lady was your daughter, not seen since infancy by thee", "And she\nwas on her way to court, with a right good young knight, who would have\nbeen her husband, but was slain by treachery of a felon knight, Lorraine\nle Savage, as they came; and because thou wouldst not abide and help\nher, thy best friend shall fail thee in thine hour of greatest need, for\nsuch is the penance ordained thee for that deed", "\"\n\nThen did King Pellinore tell Merlin secretly of the treason he had heard\nin the forest, and Merlin by his craft so ordered that the knight who\nbare the poison was himself soon after slain by it, and so King Arthur's\nlife was saved", "VII\n\nTHE ADVENTURE OF ARTHUR AND SIR ACCOLON OF GAUL\n\n\nBeing now happily married, King Arthur for a season took his pleasure,\nwith great tournaments, and jousts, and huntings", "So once upon a time\nthe king and many of his knights rode hunting in a forest, and Arthur,\nKing Urience, and Sir Accolon of Gaul, followed after a great hart, and\nbeing all three well mounted, they chased so fast that they outsped\ntheir company, and left them many miles behind; but riding still as\nrapidly as they could go, at length their horses fell dead under them", "Then being all three on foot, and seeing the stag not far before them,\nvery weary and nigh spent--\"What shall we do,\" said King Arthur, \"for we\nare hard bested?\" \"Let us go on afoot,\" said King Urience, \"till we can\nfind some lodging", "\" At that they saw the stag lying upon the bank of a\ngreat lake, with a hound springing at his throat, and many other hounds\ntrooping towards him", "So, running forward, Arthur blew the death-note on\nhis horn, and slew the hart", "Then lifting up his eyes he saw before him\non the lake a barge, all draped down to the water's edge, with silken\nfolds and curtains, which swiftly came towards him, and touched upon\nthe sands; but when he went up close and looked in, he saw no earthly\ncreature", "Then he cried out to his companions, \"Sirs, come ye hither,\nand let us see what there is in this ship", "\" So they all three went in,\nand found it everywhere throughout furnished, and hung with rich\ndraperies of silk and gold", "By this time eventide had come, when suddenly a hundred torches were set\nup on all sides of the barge, and gave a dazzling light, and at the same\ntime came forth twelve fair damsels, and saluted King Arthur by his\nname, kneeling on their knees, and telling him that he was welcome, and\nshould have their noblest cheer, for which the king thanked them\ncourteously", "Then did they lead him and his fellows to a splendid\nchamber, where was a table spread with all the richest furniture, and\ncostliest wines and viands; and there they served them with all kinds of\nwines and meats, till Arthur wondered at the splendor of the feast,\ndeclaring he had never in his life supped better, or more royally", "After\nsupper they led him to another chamber, than which he had never beheld a\nricher, where he was left to rest", "King Urience, also, and Sir Accolon\nwere each conducted into rooms of like magnificence", "And so they all\nthree fell asleep, and being very weary slept deeply all that night", "But when the morning broke, King Urience found himself in his own house\nin Camelot, he knew not how; and Arthur awaking found himself in a dark\ndungeon, and heard around him nothing but the groans of woeful knights,\nprisoners like himself", "Then said King Arthur, \"Who are ye, thus\ngroaning and complaining?\" And some one answered him, \"Alas, we be all\nprisoners, even twenty good knights, and some of us have lain here seven\nyears--some more--nor seen the light of day for all that time", "\" \"For\nwhat cause?\" said King Arthur", "\"Know ye not then yourself?\" they\nanswered--\"we will soon tell you", "The lord of this strong castle is Sir\nDamas, and is the falsest and most traitorous knight that liveth; and he\nhath a younger brother, a good and noble knight, whose name is Outzlake", "This traitor Damas, although passing rich, will give his brother nothing\nof his wealth, and save what Outzlake keepeth to himself by force, he\nhath no share of the inheritance", "He owneth, nevertheless, one fair rich\nmanor, whereupon he liveth, loved of all men far and near", "But Damas is\nas altogether hated as his brother is beloved, for he is merciless and\ncowardly: and now for many years there hath been war between these\nbrothers, and Sir Outzlake evermore defieth Damas to come forth and\nfight with him, body to body, for the inheritance; and if he be too\ncowardly, to find some champion knight that will fight for him", "And\nDamas hath agreed to find some champion, but never yet hath found a\nknight to take his evil cause in hand, or wager battle for him", "So with\na strong band of men-at-arms he lieth ever in ambush, and taketh captive\nevery passing knight who may unwarily go near and bringeth him into this\ncastle, and desireth him either to fight Sir Outzlake, or to lie for\nevermore indurance", "And thus hath he dealt with all of us, for we all\nscorned to take up such a cause for such a false foul knight--but rather\none by one came here, where many a good knight hath died of hunger and\ndisease", "But if one of us would fight, Sir Damas would deliver all the\nrest", "\"\n\n\"God of his mercy send you deliverance,\" said King Arthur, and sat\nturning in his mind how all these things should end, and how he might\nhimself gain freedom for so many noble hearts", "Anon there came a damsel to the king, saying, \"Sir, if thou wilt fight\nfor my lord thou shalt be delivered out of prison, but else nevermore\nshalt thou escape with thy life", "\" \"Nay,\" said King Arthur, \"that is but\na hard choice, yet had I rather fight than die in prison, and if I may\ndeliver not myself alone, but all these others, I will do the battle", "\"\n\"Yea,\" said the damsel, \"it shall be even so", "\" \"Then,\" said King Arthur,\n\"I am ready now, if but I had a horse and armor", "\" \"Fear not,\" said she,\n\"that shalt thou have presently, and shalt lack nothing proper for the\nfight", "\" \"Have I not seen thee,\" said the king, \"at King Arthur's court?\nfor it seemeth that thy face is known to me", "\" \"Nay,\" said the damsel, \"I\nwas never there; I am Sir Damas' daughter, and have never been but a\nday's journey from this castle", "\" But she spoke falsely, for she was one\nof the damsels of Morgan le Fay, the great enchantress, who was King\nArthur's half-sister", "When Sir Damas knew that there had been at length a knight found who\nwould fight for him, he sent for Arthur, and finding him a man so tall\nand strong, and straight of limb, he was passingly well pleased, and\nmade a covenant with him, that he should fight unto the uttermost for\nhis cause, and that all the other knights should be delivered", "And when\nthey were sworn to each other on the Holy Gospels, all those imprisoned\nknights were straightway led forth and delivered, but abode there one\nand all to see the battle", "In the meanwhile there had happened to Sir Accolon of Gaul a strange\nadventure; for when he awoke from his deep sleep upon the silken barge,\nhe found himself upon the edge of a deep well, and in instant peril of\nfalling thereinto", "Whereat, leaping up in great affright, he crossed\nhimself and cried aloud, \"May God preserve my lord King Arthur and King\nUrience, for those damsels in the ship have betrayed us, and were\ndoubtless devils and no women; and if I may escape this misadventure, I\nwill certainly destroy them wheresoever I may find them", "\" With that\nthere came to him a dwarf with a great mouth, and a flat nose, and\nsaluted him, saying that he came from Queen Morgan le Fay", "\"And she\ngreeteth you well,\" said he, \"and biddeth you be strong of heart, for\nto-morrow you shall do battle with a strange knight, and therefore she\nhath sent you here Excalibur, King Arthur's sword, and the scabbard\nlikewise", "And she desireth you as you do love her to fight this battle\nto the uttermost, and without any mercy, as you have promised her you\nwould fight when she should require it of you; and she will make a rich\nqueen forever of any damsel that shall bring her that knight's head\nwith whom you are to fight", "\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Sir Accolon, \"tell you my lady Queen Morgan, that I shall\nhold to that I promised her, now that I have this sword--and,\" said he,\n\"I suppose it was to bring about this battle that she made all these\nenchantments by her craft", "\" \"You have guessed rightly,\" said the dwarf,\nand therewithal he left him", "Then came a knight and lady, and six squires, to Sir Accolon, and took\nhim to a manor house hard by, and gave him noble cheer; and the house\nbelonged to Sir Outzlake, the brother of Sir Damas, for so had Morgan le\nFay contrived with her enchantments", "Now Sir Outzlake himself was at\nthat time sorely wounded and disabled, having been pierced through both\nhis thighs by a spear-thrust", "When, therefore, Sir Damas sent down\nmessengers to his brother, bidding him make ready by to-morrow morning,\nand be in the field to fight with a good knight, for that he had found a\nchampion ready to do battle at all points, Sir Outzlake was sorely\nannoyed and distressed, for he knew he had small chance of victory,\nwhile yet he was disabled by his wounds; notwithstanding, he determined\nto take the battle in hand, although he was so weak that he must needs\nbe lifted to his saddle", "But when Sir Accolon of Gaul heard this, he\nsent a message to Sir Outzlake offering to take the battle in his stead,\nwhich cheered Sir Outzlake mightily, who thanked Sir Accolon with all\nhis heart, and joyfully accepted him", "So, on the morrow, King Arthur was armed and well horsed, and asked Sir\nDamas, \"When shall we go to the field?\" \"Sir,\" said Sir Damas, \"you\nshall first hear mass", "\" And when mass was done, there came a squire on a\ngreat horse, and asked Sir Damas if his knight were ready, \"for our\nknight is already in the field", "\" Then King Arthur mounted on horseback,\nand there around were all the knights, and barons, and people of the\ncountry; and twelve of them were chosen to wait upon the two knights who\nwere about to fight", "And as King Arthur sat on horseback, there came a\ndamsel from Morgan le Fay, and brought to him a sword, made like\nExcalibur, and a scabbard also, and said to him, \"Morgan le Fay sendeth\nyou here your sword for her great love's sake", "\" And the king thanked\nher, and believed it to be as she said; but she traitorously deceived\nhim, for both sword and scabbard were counterfeit, brittle, and false,\nand the true sword Excalibur was in the hands of Sir Accolon", "Then, at\nthe sound of a trumpet, the champions set themselves on opposite side of\nthe field, and giving rein and spur to their horses urged them to so\ngreat a speed that each smiting the other in the middle of the shield,\nrolled his opponent to the ground, both horse and man", "Then starting up\nimmediately, both drew their swords and rushed swiftly together", "And so\nthey fell to eagerly, and gave each other many great and mighty strokes", "And as they were thus fighting, the damsel Vivien, lady of the lake, who\nloved King Arthur, came upon the ground, for she knew by her\nenchantments how Morgan le Fay had craftily devised to have King Arthur\nslain by his own sword that day, and therefore came to save his life", "And Arthur and Sir Accolon were now grown hot against each other, and\nspared not strength nor fury in their fierce assaults; but the king's\nsword gave way continually before Sir Accolon's, so that at every stroke\nhe was sore wounded, and his blood ran from him so fast that it was a\nmarvel he could stand", "When King Arthur saw the ground so sore\nbe-blooded, he bethought him in dismay that there was magic treason\nworked upon him, and that his own true sword was changed, for it seemed\nto him that the sword in Sir Accolon's hand was Excalibur, for fearfully\nit drew his blood at every blow, while what he held himself kept no\nsharp edge, nor fell with any force upon his foe", "\"Now, knight, look to thyself, and keep thee well from me,\" cried out\nSir Accolon", "But King Arthur answered not, and gave him such a buffet on\nthe helm as made him stagger and nigh fall upon the ground", "Then Sir\nAccolon withdrew a little, and came on with Excalibur on high, and smote\nKing Arthur in return with such a mighty stroke as almost felled him;\nand both being now in hottest wrath, they gave each other grievous and\nsavage blows", "But Arthur all the time was losing so much blood that\nscarcely could he keep upon his feet, yet so full was he of knighthood,\nthat knightly he endured the pain, and still sustained himself, though\nnow he was so feeble that he thought himself about to die", "Sir Accolon,\nas yet, had lost no drop of blood, and being very bold and confident in\nExcalibur, even grew more vigorous and hasty in his assaults", "But all\nmen who beheld them said they never saw a knight fight half so well as\ndid King Arthur, and all the people were so grieved for him that they\nbesought Sir Damas and Sir Outzlake to make up their quarrel and so stay\nthe fight; but they would not", "So still the battle raged, till Arthur drew a little back for breath and\na few moments' rest; but Accolon came on after him, following fiercely\nand crying loud, \"It is no time for me to suffer thee to rest,\" and\ntherewith set upon him", "Then Arthur, full of scorn and rage, lifted up\nhis sword and struck Sir Accolon upon the helm so mightily that he drove\nhim to his knees; but with the force of that great stroke his brittle,\ntreacherous sword broke short off at the hilt, and fell down in the\ngrass among the blood, leaving the pommel only in his hand", "At that,\nKing Arthur thought within himself that all was over, and secretly\nprepared his mind for death, yet kept himself so knightly sheltered by\nhis shield that he lost no ground, and made as though he yet had hope\nand cheer", "Then said Sir Accolon, \"Sir knight, thou now art overcome and\ncanst endure no longer, seeing thou art weaponless, and hast lost\nalready so much blood", "Yet am I fully loth to slay thee; yield, then,\ntherefore, to me as recreant", "\" \"Nay,\" said King Arthur, \"that may I not,\nfor I have promised to do battle to the uttermost by the faith of my\nbody while my life lasteth; and I had rather die with honor than live\nwith shame; and if it were possible for me to die an hundred times, I\nhad rather die as often than yield me to thee, for though I lack\nweapons, I shall lack no worship, and it shall be to thy shame to slay\nme weaponless", "\" \"Aha,\" shouted then Sir Accolon, \"as for the shame, I\nwill not spare; look to thyself, sir knight, for thou art even now but a\ndead man", "\" Therewith he drove at him with pitiless force, and struck him\nnearly down; but Arthur evermore waxing in valor as he waned in blood,\npressed on Sir Accolon with his shield, and hit at him so fiercely with\nthe pommel in his hand, as hurled him three strides backward", "This, therefore, so confused Sir Accolon, that rushing up, all dizzy, to\ndeliver once again a furious blow, even as he struck, Excalibur, by\nVivien's magic, fell from out his hands upon the earth", "Beholding which,\nKing Arthur lightly sprang to it, and grasped it, and forthwith felt it\nwas his own good sword, and said to it, \"Thou hast been from me all too\nlong, and done me too much damage", "\" Then spying the scabbard hanging by\nSir Accolon's side, he sprang and pulled it from him, and cast it away\nas far as he could throw it; for so long as he had worn it, Arthur knew\nhis life would have been kept secure", "\"Oh, knight!\" then said the king,\n\"thou hast this day wrought me much damage by this sword, but now art\nthou come to thy death, for I shall not warrant thee but that thou shalt\nsuffer, ere we part, somewhat of that thou hast made me suffer", "\" And\ntherewithal King Arthur flew at him with all his might, and pulled him\nto the earth, and then struck off his helm, and gave him on the head a\nfearful buffet, till the blood leaped forth", "\"Now will I slay thee!\"\ncried King Arthur; for his heart was hardened, and his body all on fire\nwith fever, till for a moment he forgot his knightly mercy", "\"Slay me\nthou mayest,\" said Sir Accolon, \"for thou art the best knight I ever\nfound, and I see well that God is with thee; and I, as thou hast, have\npromised to fight this battle to the uttermost, and never to be recreant\nwhile I live; therefore shall I never yield me with my mouth, and God\nmust do with my body what he will", "\" And as Sir Accolon spoke, King\nArthur thought he knew his voice; and parting all his blood-stained hair\nfrom out his eyes, and leaning down towards him, saw, indeed, it was his\nfriend and own true knight", "Then said he--keeping his own visor down--\"I\npray thee tell me of what country art thou, and what court?\" \"Sir\nknight,\" he answered, \"I am of King Arthur's court, and my name is Sir\nAccolon of Gaul", "\" Then said the king, \"Oh, sir knight! I pray thee tell\nme who gave thee this sword? and from whom thou hadst it?\"\n\nThen said Sir Accolon, \"Woe worth this sword, for by it I have gotten my\ndeath", "This sword hath been in my keeping now for almost twelve months,\nand yesterday Queen Morgan le Fay, wife of King Urience, sent it to me\nby a dwarf, that therewith I might in some way slay her brother, King\nArthur; for thou must understand that King Arthur is the man she hateth\nmost in all the world, being full of envy and jealousy because he is of\ngreater worship and renown than any other of her blood", "She loveth me\nalso as much as she doth hate him; and if she might contrive to slay\nKing Arthur by her craft and magic, then would she straightway kill her\nhusband also, and make me the king of all this land, and herself my\nqueen, to reign with me; but now,\" said he, \"all that is over, for this\nday I am come to my death", "\"\n\n\"It would have been sore treason of thee to destroy thy lord,\" said\nArthur", "\"Thou sayest truly,\" answered he; \"but now that I have told\nthee, and openly confessed to thee all that foul treason whereof I now\ndo bitterly repent, tell me, I pray thee, whence art thou, and of what\ncourt?\" \"O, Sir Accolon!\" said King Arthur, \"learn that I am myself King\nArthur", "\" When Sir Accolon heard this he cried aloud, \"Alas, my gracious\nlord! have mercy on me, for I knew thee not", "\" \"Thou shalt have mercy,\"\nsaid he, \"for thou knewest not my person at this time; and though by\nthine own confession thou art a traitor, yet do I blame thee less,\nbecause thou hast been blinded by the false crafts of my sister Morgan\nle Fay, whom I have trusted more than all others of my kin, and whom I\nnow shall know well how to punish", "\" Then did Sir Accolon cry loudly, \"O,\nlords, and all good people! this noble knight that I have fought with is\nthe noblest and most worshipful in all the world; for it is King Arthur,\nour liege lord and sovereign king; and full sorely I repent that I have\never lifted lance against him, though in ignorance I did it", "\"\n\nThen all the people fell down on their knees and prayed the pardon of\nthe king for suffering him to come to such a strait", "But he replied,\n\"Pardon ye cannot have, for, truly, ye have nothing sinned; but here ye\nsee what ill adventure may ofttimes befall knights-errant, for to my own\nhurt, and his danger also, I have fought with one of my own knights", "\"\n\nThen the king commanded Sir Damas to surrender to his brother the whole\nmanor, Sir Outzlake only yielding him a palfrey every year; \"for,\" said\nhe scornfully, \"it would become thee better to ride on than a courser;\"\nand ordered Damas, upon pain of death, never again to touch or to\ndistress knights-errant riding on their adventures; and also to make\nfull compensation and satisfaction to the twenty knights whom he had\nheld in prison", "\"And if any of them,\" said the king, \"come to my court\ncomplaining that he hath not had full satisfaction of thee for his\ninjuries, by my head, thou shalt die therefor", "\"\n\nAfterwards, King Arthur asked Sir Outzlake to come with him to his\ncourt, where he should become a knight of his, and, if his deeds were\nnoble, be advanced to all he might desire", "So then he took his leave of all the people and mounted upon horseback,\nand Sir Accolon went with him to an abbey hard by, where both their\nwounds were dressed", "But Sir Accolon died within four days after", "And\nwhen he was dead, the king sent his body to Queen Morgan, to Camelot,\nsaying that he sent her a present in return for the sword Excalibur\nwhich she had sent him by the damsel", "So, on the morrow, there came a damsel from Queen Morgan to the king,\nand brought with her the richest mantle that ever was seen, for it was\nset as full of precious stones as they could stand against each other,\nand they were the richest stones that ever the king saw", "And the damsel\nsaid, \"Your sister sendeth you this mantle, and prayeth you to take her\ngift, and in whatsoever thing she hath offended you, she will amend it\nat your pleasure", "\" To this the king replied not, although the mantle\npleased him much", "With that came in the lady of the lake, and said,\n\"Sir, put not on this mantle till thou hast seen more; and in nowise let\nit be put upon thee, or any of thy knights, till ye have made the\nbringer of it first put it on her", "\" \"It shall be done as thou dost\ncounsel,\" said the king", "Then said he to the damsel that came from his\nsister, \"Damsel, I would see this mantle ye have brought me upon\nyourself", "\" \"Sir,\" said she, \"it will not beseem me to wear a knight's\ngarment", "\" \"By my head,\" said King Arthur, \"thou shalt wear it ere it go\non any other person's back!\" And so they put it on her by force, and\nforthwith the garment burst into a flame and burned the damsel into\ncinders", "When the king saw that, he hated that false witch Morgan le Fay\nwith all his heart, and evermore was deadly quarrel between her and\nArthur to their lives' end", "VIII\n\nARTHUR IS CROWNED EMPEROR AT ROME\n\n\nAnd now again the second time there came ambassadors from Lucius\nTiberius, Emperor of Rome, demanding, under pain of war, tribute and\nhomage from King Arthur, and the restoration of all Gaul, which he had\nconquered from the tribune Flollo", "When they had delivered their message, the king bade them withdraw while\nhe consulted with his knights and barons what reply to send", "Then some\nof the younger knights would have slain the ambassadors, saying that\ntheir speech was a rebuke to all who heard the king insulted by it", "But\nwhen King Arthur heard that, he ordered none to touch them upon pain of\ndeath; and sending officers, he had them taken to a noble lodging, and\nthere entertained with the best cheer", "\"And,\" said he, \"let no dainty be\nspared, for the Romans are great lords; and though their message please\nme not, yet must I remember mine honor", "\"\n\nThen the lords and knights of the Round Table were called on to declare\ntheir counsel--what should be done upon this matter;

and when they had passed through it, they came to a\ngreat plain, and the weather being very hot about noontide, Sir Lancelot\ngreatly longed to sleep", "Then Sir Lionel espied a great apple-tree\nstanding by a hedge, and said, \"Brother, yonder is a fair shadow where\nwe may rest ourselves and horses", "\"\n\n\"I am full glad of it,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"for all these seven years I\nhave not been so sleepy", "\"\n\nSo they alighted there, and tied their horses up to sundry trees;

then came he to the second,\nand smote him such a stroke that horse and man went to the earth; then\nrode he to the third, likewise, and struck him off his horse more than a\nspear's length", "With that he lighted from his horse, and bound all three\nknights fast with the reins of their own bridles", "When Sir Lionel saw this he thought the time was come to prove himself\nagainst him, so quietly and cautiously, lest he should wake Sir\nLancelot, he took his horse and mounted and rode after him", "Presently\novertaking him, he cried aloud to him to turn, which instantly he did,\nand smote Sir Lionel so hard that horse and man went down forthwith", "Then took he up Sir Lionel, and threw him bound over his own horse's\nback;

and soon they both had many grim and fearful\nwounds, and bled in streams", "Thus they fought two hours and more,\nthrusting and smiting at each other, wherever they could hit", "Anon, they both were breathless, and stood leaning on their swords", "\"Now, comrade,\" said Sir Turquine, \"let us wait awhile, and answer me\nwhat I shall ask thee", "\"\n\n\"Say on,\" said Lancelot", "\"Thou art,\" said Turquine, \"the best man I ever met, and seemest like\none that I hate above all other knights that live; but if thou be not\nhe, I will make peace with thee, and for sake of thy great valor, will\ndeliver all the three score prisoners and four who lie within my\ndungeons, and thou and I will be companions evermore", "Tell me, then, thy\nname", "\"\n\n\"Thou sayest well,\" replied Sir Lancelot; \"but who is he thou hatest so\nabove all others?\"\n\n\"His name,\" said Turquine, \"is Sir Lancelot of the Lake; and he slew my\nbrother Sir Carados, at the dolorous tower; wherefore, if ever I shall\nmeet with him, one of us two shall slay the other; and thereto I have\nsworn by a great oath", "And to discover and destroy him I have slain a\nhundred knights, and crippled utterly as many more, and many have died\nin my prisons; and now, as I have told thee, I have many more therein,\nwho all shall be delivered, if thou tell me thy name, and it be not Sir\nLancelot", "\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Lancelot, \"I am that knight, son of King Ban of Benwick,\nand Knight of the Round Table; so now I defy thee to do thy best!\"\n\n\"Aha!\" said Turquine, with a shout, \"is it then so at last! Thou art\nmore welcome to my sword than ever knight or lady was to feast, for\nnever shall we part till one of us be dead", "\"\n\nThen did they hurtle together like two wild bulls, slashing and lashing\nwith their shields and swords, and sometimes falling both on to the\nground", "For two more hours they fought so, and at the last Sir Turquine\ngrew very faint, and gave a little back, and bare his shield full low\nfor weariness", "When Sir Lancelot saw him thus, he leaped upon him\nfiercely as a lion, and took him by the crest of his helmet, and dragged\nhim to his knees; and then he tore his helmet off and smote his neck\nasunder", "Then he arose, and went to the damsel who had brought him to Sir\nTurquine, and said, \"I am ready, fair lady, to go with thee upon thy\nservice, but I have no horse", "\"\n\n\"Fair sir,\" said she, \"take ye this horse of the wounded knight whom\nTurquine but just now was carrying to his prisons, and send that knight\non to deliver all the prisoners", "\"\n\nSo Sir Lancelot went to the knight and prayed him for the loan of his\nhorse", "\"Fair lord,\" said he, \"ye are right welcome, for to-day ye have saved\nboth me and my horse; and I see that ye are the best knight in all the\nworld, for in my sight have ye slain the mightiest man and the best\nknight, except thyself, I ever saw", "\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"I thank thee well; and now go into yonder\ncastle, where thou shalt find many noble knights of the Round Table, for\nI have seen their shields hung on the trees around", "On yonder tree alone\nthere are Sir Key's, Sir Brandel's, Sir Marhaus', Sir Galind's, and Sir\nAliduke's, and many more; and also my two kinsmen's shields, Sir Ector\nde Maris' and Sir Lionel's", "And I pray you greet them all from me, Sir\nLancelot of the Lake, and tell them that I bid them help themselves to\nany treasures they can find within the castle; and that I pray my\nbrethren, Lionel and Ector, to go to King Arthur's court and stay there\ntill I come", "And by the high feast at Pentecost I must be there; but now\nI must ride forth with this damsel to fulfill my promise", "\"\n\nSo, as they went, the damsel told him, \"Sir, we are now near the place\nwhere the foul knight haunteth, who robbeth and distresseth all ladies\nand gentlewomen traveling past this way, against whom I have sought thy\naid", "\"\n\nThen they arranged that she should ride on foremost, and Sir Lancelot\nshould follow under cover of the trees by the roadside, and if he saw\nher come to any mishap, he should ride forth and deal with him that\ntroubled her", "And as the damsel rode on at a soft ambling pace, a knight\nand page burst forth from the roadside and forced the damsel from her\nhorse, till she cried out for help", "Then came Sir Lancelot rushing through the wood as fast as he might fly,\nand all the branches of the trees crackled and waved around him", "\"O thou\nfalse knight and traitor to all knighthood!\" shouted he, \"who taught\nthee to distress fair ladies thus?\"\n\nThe foul knight answered nothing, but drew out his sword and rode at Sir\nLancelot, who threw his spear away and drew his own sword likewise, and\nstruck him such a mighty blow as clave his head down to the throat", "\"Now\nhast thou the wages thou long hast earned!\" said he; and so departed\nfrom the damsel", "Then for two days he rode in a great forest, and had but scanty food and\nlodging, and on the third day he rode over a long bridge, when suddenly\nthere started up a passing foul churl, and smote his horse across the\nnose, so that he started and turned back, rearing with pain", "\"Why ridest\nthou over here without my leave?\" said he", "\"Why should I not?\" said Sir Lancelot; \"there is no other way to ride", "\"\n\n\"Thou shalt not pass by here,\" cried out the churl, and dashed at him\nwith a great club full of iron spikes, till Sir Lancelot was fain to\ndraw his sword and smite him dead upon the earth", "At the end of the bridge was a fair village, and all the people came and\ncried, \"Ah, sir! a worse deed for thyself thou never didst, for thou\nhast slain the chief porter of the castle yonder!\" But he let them talk\nas they pleased, and rode straight forward to the castle", "There he alighted, and tied his horse to a ring in the wall; and going\nin, he saw a wide green court, and thought it seemed a noble place to\nfight in", "And as he looked about, he saw many people watching him from\ndoors and windows, making signs of warning, and saying, \"Fair knight,\nthou art unhappy", "\" In the next moment came upon him two great giants,\nwell armed save their heads, and with two horrible clubs in their hands", "Then he put his shield before him, and with it warded off one giant's\nstroke, and clove the other with his sword from the head downward to the\nchest", "When the first giant saw that, he ran away mad with fear; but Sir\nLancelot ran after him, and smote him through the shoulder, and shore\nhim down his back, so that he fell dead", "Then he walked onward to the castle hall, and saw a band of sixty ladies\nand young damsels coming forth, who knelt to him, and thanked him for\ntheir freedom", "\"For, sir,\" said they, \"the most of us have been\nprisoners here these seven years; and have been kept at all manner of\nwork to earn our meat, though we be all great gentlewomen born", "Blessed\nbe the time that thou wast born, for never did a knight a deed of\ngreater worship than thou hast this day, and thereto will we all bear\nwitness in all times and places! Tell us, therefore, noble knight, thy\nname and court, that we may tell them to our friends!\" And when they\nheard it, they all cried aloud, \"Well may it be so, for we knew that no\nknight save thou shouldst ever overcome those giants; and many a long\nday have we sighed for thee; for the giants feared no other name among\nall knights but thine", "\"\n\nThen he told them to take the treasures of the castle as a reward for\ntheir grievances; and to return to their homes, and so rode away into\nmany strange and wild countries", "And at last, after many days, by chance\nhe came, near the night time, to a fair mansion, wherein he found an old\ngentlewoman, who gave him and his horse good cheer", "And when bed time\nwas come, his host brought him to a chamber over a gate, and there he\nunarmed, and went to bed and fell asleep", "But soon thereafter came one riding in great haste, and knocking\nvehemently at the gate below, which when Sir Lancelot heard, he rose\nand looked out of the window, and, by the moonlight, saw three knights\ncome riding fiercely after one man, and lashing on him all at once with\ntheir swords, while the one knight nobly fought them all", "Then Sir Lancelot quickly armed himself, and getting through the window,\nlet himself down by a sheet into the midst of them, crying out, \"Turn ye\non me, ye cowards, and leave fighting with that knight!\" Then they all\nleft Sir Key, for the first knight was he, and began to fall upon Sir\nLancelot furiously", "And when Sir Key would have come forward to assist\nhim, Sir Lancelot refused, and cried, \"Leave me alone to deal with\nthem", "\" And presently, with six great strokes, he felled them all", "Then they cried out, \"Sir knight, we yield us unto thee, as to a man of\nmight!\"\n\n\"I will not take your yielding!\" said he; \"yield ye to Sir Key, the\nseneschal, or I will have your lives", "\"\n\n\"Fair knight,\" said they, \"excuse us in that thing, for we have chased\nSir Key thus far, and should have overcome him but for thee", "\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"do as ye will, for ye may live or die; but,\nif ye live, ye shall be holden to Sir Key", "\"\n\nThen they yielded to him; and Sir Lancelot commanded them to go unto\nKing Arthur's court at the next Pentecost, and say, Sir Key had sent\nthem prisoners to Queen Guinevere", "And this they sware to do upon their\nswords", "Then Sir Lancelot knocked at the gate with his sword-hilt till his\nhostess came and let him in again, and Sir Key also", "And when the light\ncame, Sir Key knew Sir Lancelot, and knelt and thanked him for his\ncourtesy, and gentleness, and kindness", "\"Sir,\" said he, \"I have done no\nmore than what I ought to do, and ye are welcome; therefore let us now\ntake rest", "\"\n\nSo when Sir Key had supped, they went to sleep, and Sir Lancelot and he\nslept in the same bed", "On the morrow, Sir Lancelot rose early, and took\nSir Key's shield and armor and set forth", "When Sir Key arose, he found\nSir Lancelot's armor by his bedside, and his own arms gone", "\"Now, by my\nfaith,\" thought he, \"I know that he will grieve some knights of our\nking's court;

\"let us now go\nto our brother Gaunter's rescue; we shall have enough to do to match\nthat knight, for, by his stature, I believe it is Sir Lancelot or Sir\nTristram", "\"\n\nAnon, they took their horses and galloped after Sir Lancelot;

\"choose therefore, but take\nall the issues of thy choice", "\"\n\nSo when he had looked around, he chose the wife of Earl Segwarides, and\ntook her by the hand, and set her upon horseback behind his squire, and\nrode forth on his way", "Presently thereafter came in the earl, and rode out straightway after\nhim in rage", "But all the ladies cried out shame upon Sir Tristram that\nhe had not gone, and one rebuked him foully and called him coward\nknight, that he would stand and see a lady forced away from his uncle's\ncourt", "But Sir Tristram answered her, \"Fair lady, it is not my place to\ntake part in this quarrel while her lord and husband is here to do it", "Had he not been at this court, peradventure I had been her champion", "And\nif it so befall that he speed ill, then may it happen that I speak with\nthat foul knight before he pass out of this realm", "\"\n\nAnon ran in one of Sir Segwarides' squires, and told that his master was\nsore wounded, and at the point of death", "When Sir Tristram heard that,\nhe was soon armed and on his horse, and Governale, his servant, followed\nhim with shield and spear", "And as he rode, he met his cousin Sir Andret, who had been commanded by\nKing Mark to bring home to him two knights of King Arthur's court who\nroamed the country thereabouts seeking adventures", "\"What tidings?\" said Sir Tristram", "\"God help me, never worse,\" replied his cousin;

achieved, but this high quest he only\nshall attain who hath clean hands and a pure heart, and valor and\nhardihood beyond all other men", "\"\n\nWhile the king spoke there came in softly an old man robed all in white,\nleading with him a young knight clad in red from top to toe, but without\narmor or shield, and having by his side an empty scabbard", "The old man went up to the king, and said, \"Lord, here I bring thee this\nyoung knight of royal lineage, and of the blood of Joseph of Arimathea,\nby whom the marvels of thy court shall fully be accomplished", "\"\n\nThe king was right glad at his words, and said, \"Sir, ye be right\nheartily welcome, and the young knight also", "\"\n\nThen the old man put on Sir Galahad (for it was he) a crimson robe\ntrimmed with fine ermine, and took him by the hand and led him to the\nPerilous Seat, and lifting up the silken cloth which hung upon it, read\nthese words written in gold letters, \"This is the seat of Sir Galahad,\nthe good knight", "\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the old man, \"this place is thine", "\"\n\nThen sat Sir Galahad down firmly and surely, and said to the old man,\n\"Sir, ye may now go your way, for ye have done well and truly all ye\nwere commanded, and commend me to my grandsire, King Pelles, and say\nthat I shall see him soon", "\" So the old man departed with a retinue of\ntwenty noble squires", "But all the knights of the Round Table marveled at Sir Galahad, and at\nhis tender age, and at his sitting there so surely in the Perilous Seat", "Then the king led Sir Galahad forth from the palace, to show him the\nadventure of the floating stone", "\"Here,\" said he, \"is as great a marvel\nas I ever saw, and right good knights have tried and failed to gain that\nsword", "\"\n\n\"I marvel not thereat,\" said Galahad, \"for this adventure is not theirs,\nbut mine; and for the certainty I had thereof, I brought no sword with\nme, as thou mayst see here by this empty scabbard", "\"\n\nAnon he laid his hand upon the sword, and lightly drew it from the\nstone, and put it in his sheath, and said, \"This sword was that\nenchanted one which erst belonged to the good knight, Sir Balin,\nwherewith he slew through piteous mistake his brother Balan; who also\nslew him at the same time: all which great woe befell him through the\ndolorous stroke he gave my grandsire, King Pelles, the wound whereof is\nnot yet whole, nor shall be till I heal him", "\"\n\nAs he stood speaking thus, they saw a lady riding swiftly down the\nriver's bank towards them, on a white palfrey, who, saluting the king\nand queen, said, \"Lord king, Nacien the hermit sendeth thee word that to\nthee shall come to-day the greatest honor and worship that hath yet ever\nbefallen a king of Britain; for this day shall the Sangreal appear in\nthy house", "\"\n\nWith that the damsel took her leave, and departed the same way she came", "\"Now,\" said the king, \"I know that from to-day the quest of the Sangreal\nshall begin, and all ye of the Round Table will be scattered so that\nnevermore shall I see ye again together as ye are now; let me then see a\njoust and tournament amongst ye for the last time before ye go", "\"\n\nSo they all took their harness and met together in the meadows by\nCamelot, and the queen and all her ladies sat in a tower to see", "Then Sir Galahad, at the prayer of the king and queen, put on a coat of\nlight armor, and a helmet, but shield he would take none, and grasping a\nlance, he drove into the middle of the press of knights, and began to\nbreak spears marvelously, so that all men were full of wonder", "And in so\nshort a time he had surmounted and exceeded the rest, save Sir Lancelot\nand Sir Percival, that he took the chief worship of the field", "Then the king and all the court and fellowship of knights went back to\nthe palace, and so to evensong in the great minster, a royal and goodly\ncompany, and after that sat down to supper in the hall, every knight in\nhis own seat, as they had been before", "Anon suddenly burst overhead the cracking and crying of great peals of\nthunder, till the palace walls were shaken sorely, and they thought to\nsee them riven all to pieces", "And in the midst of the blast there entered in a sunbeam, clearer by\nseven times than ever they saw day, and a marvelous great glory fell\nupon them all", "Then each knight, looking on his neighbor, found his face\nfairer than he had ever seen, and so--all standing on their feet--they\ngazed as dumb men on each other, not knowing what to say", "Then entered into the hall the Sangreal, borne aloft without hands\nthrough the midst of the sunbeam, and covered with white samite, so that\nnone might see it", "And all the hall was filled with perfume and incense,\nand every knight was fed with the food he best loved", "And when the holy\nvessel had been thus borne through the hall, it suddenly departed, no\nman saw whither", "When they recovered breath to speak, King Arthur first rose up, and\nyielded thanks to God and to our Lord", "Then Sir Gawain sprang up and said, \"Now have we all been fed by miracle\nwith whatsoever food we thought of or desired; but with our eyes we have\nnot seen the blessed vessel whence it came, so carefully and preciously\nit was concealed", "Therefore, I make a vow, that from to-morrow I shall\nlabor twelve months and a day in quest of the Sangreal, and longer if\nneed be; nor will I come again into this court until mine eyes have seen\nit evidently", "\"\n\nWhen he had spoken thus, knight after knight rose up and vowed himself\nto the same quest, till the most part of the Round Table had thus sworn", "But when King Arthur heard them all, he could not refrain his eyes from\ntears, and said, \"Sir Gawain, Sir Gawain, thou hast set me in great\nsorrow, for I fear me my true fellowship shall never meet together here\nagain; and surely never Christian king had such a company of worthy\nknights around his table at one time", "\"\n\nAnd when the queen and her ladies and gentlewomen heard the vows, they\nhad such grief and sorrow as no tongue could tell; and Queen Guinevere\ncried out, \"I marvel that my lord will suffer them to depart from him", "\"\nAnd many of the ladies who loved knights would have gone with them, but\nwere forbidden by the hermit Nacien, who sent this message to all who\nhad sworn themselves to the quest: \"Take with ye no lady nor\ngentlewoman, for into so high a service as ye go in, no thought but of\nour Lord and heaven may enter", "\"\n\nOn the morrow morning all the knights rose early, and when they were\nfully armed, save shields and helms, they went in with the king and\nqueen to service in the minster", "Then the king counted all who had taken\nthe adventure on themselves, and found them a hundred and fifty knights\nof the Round Table; and so they all put on their helms, and rode away\ntogether in the midst of cries and lamentations from the court, and from\nthe ladies, and from all the town", "But the queen went alone to her chamber, that no man might see her\nsorrow; and Sir Lancelot followed her to say farewell", "When she saw him she cried out, \"Oh, Sir Lancelot, thou hast betrayed\nme; thou hast put me to death thus to depart and leave my lord the\nking", "\"\n\n\"Ah, madam,\" said he, \"be not displeased or angry, for I shall come\nagain as soon as I can with honor", "\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said she, \"that ever I saw thee; but He that suffered death upon\nthe cross for all mankind be to thee safety and good conduct, and to all\nthy company", "\"\n\nThen Sir Lancelot saluted her and the king, and went forth with the\nrest, and came with them that night to Castle Vagon, where they abode,\nand on the morrow they departed from each other on their separate ways,\nevery knight taking the way that pleased him best", "Now Sir Galahad went forth without a shield, and rode so four days\nwithout adventure; and on the fourth day, after evensong, he came to an\nabbey of white monks, where he was received in the house, and led into a\nchamber", "And there he was unarmed, and met two knights of the Round\nTable, King Bagdemagus, and Sir Uwaine", "\"Sirs,\" said Sir Galahad, \"what adventure hath brought ye here?\"\n\n\"Within this place, as we are told,\" they answered, \"there is a shield\nno man may bear around his neck without receiving sore mischance, or\ndeath within three days", "\"\n\n\"To-morrow,\" said King Bagdemagus, \"I shall attempt the adventure; and\nif I fail, do thou, Sir Galahad, take it up after me", "\"\n\n\"I will willingly,\" said he; \"for as ye see I have no shield as yet", "\"\n\nSo on the morrow they arose and heard mass, and afterwards King\nBagdemagus asked where the shield was kept", "Then a monk led him behind\nthe altar, where the shield hung, as white as any snow, and with a\nblood-red cross in the midst of it", "\"Sir,\" said the monk, \"this shield should hang from no knight's neck\nunless he be the worthiest in the world", "I warn ye, therefore, knights;\nconsider well before ye dare to touch it", "\"\n\n\"Well,\" said King Bagdemagus, \"I know well that I am far from the best\nknight in all the world, yet shall I make the trial\"; and so he took the\nshield, and bore it from the monastery", "\"If it please thee,\" said he to Sir Galahad, \"abide here till thou\nhearest how I speed", "\"\n\n\"I will abide thee,\" said he", "Then taking with him a squire who might return with any tidings to Sir\nGalahad, the king rode forth; and before he had gone two miles, he saw\nin a fair valley a hermitage, and a knight who came forth dressed in\nwhite armor, horse and all, who rode fast against him", "When they\nencountered, Bagdemagus brake his spear upon the White Knight's shield,\nbut was himself struck through the shoulder with a sore wound, and\nhurled down from his horse", "Then the White Knight alighting, came and\ntook the white shield from the king, and said, \"Thou hast done great\nfolly, for this shield ought never to be borne but by one who hath no\nliving peer", "\" And turning to the squire, he said, \"Bear thou this shield\nto the good knight, Sir Galahad, and greet him well from me", "\"\n\n\"In whose name shall I greet him?\" said the squire", "\"Take thou no heed of that,\" he answered; \"it is not for thee or any\nearthly man to know", "\"\n\n\"Now tell me, fair sir, at the least,\" said the squire, \"why may this\nshield be never borne except its wearer come to injury or death?\"\n\n\"Because it shall belong to no man save its rightful owner, Galahad,\"\nreplied the knight", "Then the squire went to his master, and found him wounded nigh to\ndeath, wherefore he fetched his horse, and bore him back with him to the\nabbey", "And there they laid him in a bed, and looked to his wounds; and\nwhen he had lain many days grievously sick, he at the last barely\nescaped with his life", "\"Sir Galahad,\" said the squire, \"the knight who overthrew King\nBagdemagus sent you greeting, and bade you bear this shield", "\"\n\n\"Now blessed be God and fortune,\" said Sir Galahad, and hung the shield\nabout his neck, and armed him, and rode forth", "Anon he met the White Knight by the hermitage, and each saluted\ncourteously the other", "\"Sir,\" said Sir Galahad, \"this shield I bear hath surely a full\nmarvelous history", "\"\n\n\"Thou sayest rightly,\" answered he", "\"That shield was made in the days of\nJoseph of Arimathea, the gentle knight who took our Lord down from the\ncross", "He, when he left Jerusalem with his kindred, came to the country\nof King Evelake, who warred continually with one Tollome; and when, by\nthe teaching of Joseph, King Evelake became a Christian, this shield was\nmade for him in our Lord's name; and through its aid King Tollome was\ndefeated", "For when King Evelake met him next in battle, he hid it in a\nveil, and suddenly uncovering it, he showed his enemies the figure of a\nbleeding man nailed to a cross, at sight of which they were discomfited\nand fled", "Presently after that, a man whose hand was smitten off touched\nthe cross upon the shield, and had his hand restored to him; and many\nother miracles it worked", "But suddenly the cross that was upon it\nvanished away", "Anon both Joseph and King Evelake came to Britain, and by\nthe preaching of Joseph the people were made Christians", "And when at\nlength he lay upon his death-bed, King Evelake begged of him some token\nere he died", "Then, calling for his shield, he dipped his finger in his\nown blood, for he was bleeding fast, and none could staunch the wound,\nand marked that cross upon it, saying, 'This cross shall ever show as\nbright as now, and the last of my lineage shall wear this shield about\nhis neck, and go forth to all the marvelous deeds he will achieve", "'\"\n\nWhen the White Knight had thus spoken he vanished suddenly away, and Sir\nGalahad returned to the abbey", "As he alighted, came a monk, and prayed him to go see a tomb in the\nchurchyard, wherefrom came such a great and hideous noise, that none\ncould hear it but they went nigh mad, or lost all strength", "\"And, sir,\"\nsaid he, \"I deem it is a fiend", "\"\n\n\"Lead me thither,\" said Sir Galahad", "When they were come near the place, \"Now,\" said the monk, \"go thou to\nthe tomb, and lift it up", "\"\n\nAnd Galahad, nothing afraid, quickly lifted up the stone, and forthwith\ncame out a foul smoke, and from the midst thereof leaped up the\nloathliest figure that ever he had seen in the likeness of man; and\nGalahad blessed himself, for he knew it was a fiend of hell", "Then he\nheard a voice crying out, \"Oh, Galahad, I cannot tear thee as I would; I\nsee so many angels round thee, that I may not come at thee", "\"\n\nThen the fiend suddenly disappeared with a marvelous great cry; and Sir\nGalahad, looking in the tomb, saw there a body all armed, with a sword\nbeside it", "\"Now, fair brother,\" said he to the monk, \"let us remove this\ncursed body, which is not fit to lie in a churchyard, for when it lived,\na false and perjured Christian man dwelt in it", "Cast it away, and there\nshall come no more hideous noises from the tomb", "\"\n\n\"And now must I depart,\" he added, \"for I have much in hand, and am upon\nthe holy quest of the Sangreal, with many more good knights", "\"\n\nSo he took his leave, and rode many journeys backwards and forwards as\nadventure would lead him; and at last one day he departed from a castle\nwithout first hearing mass, which was it ever his custom to hear before\nhe left his lodging", "Anon he found a ruined chapel on a mountain, and\nwent in and kneeled before the altar, and prayed for wholesome counsel\nwhat to do; and as he prayed he heard a voice, which said, \"Depart,\nadventurous knight, unto the Maiden's Castle, and redress the violence\nand wrongs there done!\"\n\nHearing these words he cheerfully arose, and mounted his horse, and rode\nbut half a mile, when he saw before him a strong castle, with deep\nditches round it, and a fair river running past", "And seeing an old churl\nhard by, he asked him what men called that castle", "\"Fair sir,\" said he, \"it is the Maiden's Castle", "\"\n\n\"It is a cursed place,\" said Galahad, \"and all its masters are but\nfelons, full of mischief and hardness and shame", "\"\n\n\"For that good reason,\" said the old man, \"thou wert well-advised to\nturn thee back", "\"\n\n\"For that same reason,\" quoth Sir Galahad, \"will I the more certainly\nride on", "\"\n\nThen, looking at his armor carefully, to see that nothing failed him, he\nwent forward, and presently there met him seven damsels, who cried out,\n\"Sir knight, thou ridest in great peril, for thou hast two waters to\npass over", "\"\n\n\"Why should I not pass over them?\" said he, and rode straight on", "Anon he met a squire, who said, \"Sir knight, the masters of this castle\ndefy thee, and bid thee go no further, till thou showest them thy\nbusiness here", "\"\n\n\"Fair fellow,\" said Sir Galahad, \"I am come here to destroy their wicked\ncustoms", "\"\n\n\"If that be thy purpose,\" answered he, \"thou wilt have much to do", "\"\n\n\"Go thou,\" said Galahad, \"and hasten with my message", "\"\n\nIn a few minutes after rode forth furiously from the gateways of the\ncastle seven knights, all brothers, and crying out, \"Knight, keep thee,\"\nbore down all at once upon Sir Galahad", "But thrusting forth his spear,\nhe smote the foremost to the earth, so that his neck was almost broken,\nand warded with his shield the spears of all the others, which every one\nbrake off from it, and shivered into pieces", "Then he drew out his sword,\nand set upon them hard and fiercely, and by his wondrous force drave\nthem before him, and chased them to the castle gate, and there he slew\nthem", "At that came out to him an ancient man, in priest's vestments, saying,\n\"Behold, sir, here, the keys of this castle", "\"\n\nThen he unlocked the gates, and found within a multitude of people, who\ncried out, \"Sir knight, ye be welcome, for long have we waited thy\ndeliverance,\" and told him that the seven felons he had slain had long\nenslaved the people round about, and killed all knights who passed that\nway, because the maiden whom they had robbed of the castle had foretold\nthat by one knight they should themselves be overthrown", "\"Where is the maiden?\" asked Sir Galahad", "\"She lingereth below in a dungeon,\" said they", "So Sir Galahad went down and released her, and restored her her\ninheritance; and when he had summoned the barons of the country to do\nher homage, he took his leave, and departed", "Presently thereafter, as he rode, he entered a great forest, and in a\nglade thereof met two knights, disguised, who proffered him to joust", "These were Sir Lancelot, his father, and Sir Percival, but neither knew\nthe other", "So he and Sir Lancelot encountered first, and Sir Galahad\nsmote down his father", "Then drawing his sword, for his spear was broken,\nhe fought with Sir Percival, and struck so mightily that he clave Sir\nPercival's helm, and smote him from his horse", "Now hard by where they fought there was a hermitage, where dwelt a pious\nwoman, a recluse, who, when she heard the sound, came forth, and seeing\nSir Galahad ride, she cried, \"God be with thee, the best knight in the\nworld; had yonder knights known thee as well as I do, they would not\nhave encountered with thee", "\"\n\nWhen Sir Galahad heard that, fearing to be made known, he forthwith\nsmote his horse with his spurs, and departed at a great pace", "Sir Lancelot and Sir Percival heard her words also, and rode fast after\nhim, but within a while he was out of their sight", "Then Sir Percival\nrode back to ask his name of the recluse; but Sir Lancelot went forward\non his quest, and following any path his horse would take, he came\nby-and-by after nightfall to a stone cross hard by an ancient chapel", "When he had alighted and tied his horse up to a tree, he went and looked\nin through the chapel door, which was all ruinous and wasted, and there\nwithin he saw an altar, richly decked with silk, whereon there stood a\nfair candlestick of silver, bearing six great lights", "And when Sir\nLancelot saw the light, he tried to get within the chapel, but could\nfind no place", "So, being passing weary and heavy, he came again to his\nhorse, and when he had unsaddled him, and set him free to pasture, he\nunlaced his helm, and ungirded his sword, and laid him down to sleep\nupon his shield before the cross", "And while he lay between waking and sleeping, he saw come by him two\nwhite palfreys bearing a litter, wherein a sick knight lay, and the\npalfreys stood still by the cross", "Then Sir Lancelot heard the sick man\nsay, \"O sweet Lord, when shall this sorrow leave me, and the holy\nvessel pass by me, wherethrough I shall be blessed? for I have long\nendured", "\"\n\nWith that Sir Lancelot saw the chapel open, and the candlestick with the\nsix tapers come before the cross, but he could see none who bare it", "Then came there also a table of silver, and thereon the holy vessel of\nthe Sangreal", "And when the sick knight saw that, he sat up, and lifting\nboth his hands, said, \"Fair Lord, sweet Lord, who art here within this\nholy vessel, have mercy on me, that I may be whole\"; and therewith he\ncrept upon his hands and knees so nigh, that he might touch the vessel;\nand when he had kissed it, he leaped up, and stood and cried aloud,\n\"Lord God, I thank Thee, for I am made whole", "\" Then the Holy Grail\ndeparted with the table and the silver candlestick into the chapel, so\nthat Sir Lancelot saw it no more, nor for his sins' sake could he follow\nit", "And the knight who was healed went on his way", "Then Sir Lancelot awake, and marveled whether he had seen aught but a\ndream", "And as he marveled, he heard a voice saying, \"Sir Lancelot, thou\nart unworthy, go thou hence, and withdraw thee from this holy place", "\"\nAnd when he heard that, he was passing heavy, for he bethought him of\nhis sins", "So he departed weeping, and cursed the day of his birth, for the words\nwent into his heart, and he knew wherefore he was thus driven forth", "Then he went to seek his arms and horse, but could not find them; and\nthen he called himself the wretchedest and most unhappy of all knights,\nand said, \"My sin hath brought me unto great dishonor: for when I\nsought earthly honors, I achieved them ever; but now I take upon me holy\nthings, my guilt doth hinder me, and shameth me; therefore had I no\npower to stir or speak when the holy blood appeared before me", "\"\n\nSo thus he sorrowed till it was day, and he heard the birds sing; then\nwas he somewhat comforted, and departing from the cross on foot, he came\ninto a wild forest, and to a high mountain, and there he found a\nhermitage; and, kneeling before the hermit down upon both his knees, he\ncried for mercy for his wicked works, and prayed him to hear his\nconfession", "But when he told his name, the hermit marveled to see him in\nso sore a case, and said, \"Sir, ye ought to thank God more than any\nknight living, for He hath given thee more honor than any; yet for thy\npresumption, while in deadly sin to come into the presence of His flesh\nand blood, He suffered thee neither to see nor follow it", "Wherefore,\nbelieve that all thy strength and manhood will avail thee little, when\nGod is against thee", "\"\n\nThen Sir Lancelot wept and said, \"Now know I well ye tell me truth", "\"\n\nThen he confessed to him, and told him all his sins, and how he had for\nfourteen years served but Queen Guinevere only, and forgotten God, and\ndone great deeds of arms for her, and not for Heaven, and had little or\nnothing thanked God for the honor that he won", "And then Sir Lancelot\nsaid, \"I pray you counsel me", "\"\n\n\"I will counsel thee,\" said he: \"never more enter into that queen's\ncompany when ye can avoid it", "\"\n\nSo Sir Lancelot promised him", "\"Look that your heart and your mouth accord,\" said the good man, \"and ye\nshall have more honor and more nobleness than ever ye have had", "\"\n\nThen were his arms and horse restored to him, and so he took his leave,\nand rode forth, repenting greatly", "Now Sir Percival had ridden back to the recluse, to learn who that\nknight was whom she had called the best in the world", "And when he had\ntold her that he was Sir Percival, she made passing great joy of him,\nfor she was his mother's sister, wherefore she opened her door to him,\nand made him good cheer", "And on the morrow she told him of her kindred\nto him, and they both made great rejoicing", "Then he asked her who that\nknight was, and she told him, \"He it is who on Whit Sunday last was clad\nin the red robe, and bare the red arms; and he hath no peer, for he\nworketh all by miracle, and shall be never overcome by any earthly\nhands", "\"\n\n\"By my goodwill,\" said Sir Percival, \"I will never after these tidings\nhave to do with Sir Galahad but in the way of kindness; and I would fain\nlearn where I may find him", "\"\n\n\"Fair nephew,\" said she, \"ye must ride to the Castle of Goth, where he\nhath a cousin; by him ye may be lodged, and he will teach you the way to\ngo; but if he can tell you no tidings, ride straight to the Castle of\nCarbonek, where the wounded king is lying, for there shall ye surely\nhear true tidings of him", "\"\n\nSo Sir Percival departed from his aunt, and rode till evensong time,\nwhen he was ware of a monastery closed round with walls and deep\nditches, where he knocked at the gate, and anon was let in", "And there he\nhad good cheer that night, and on the morrow heard mass", "And beside the\naltar where the priest stood, was a rich bed of silk and cloth of gold;\nand on the bed there lay a man passing old, having a crown of gold upon\nhis head, and all his body was full of great wounds, and his eyes almost\nwholly blind; and ever he held up his hands and said, \"Sweet Lord,\nforget not me!\"\n\nThen Sir Percival asked one of the brethren who he was", "\"Sir,\" said the good man, \"ye have heard of Joseph of Arimathea, how he\nwas sent of Jesus Christ into this land to preach and teach the\nChristian faith", "Now, in the city of Sarras he converted a king named\nEvelake, and this is he", "He came with Joseph to this land, and ever\ndesired greatly to see the Sangreal; so on a time he came nigh thereto,\nand was struck almost blind", "Then he cried out for mercy, and said,\n'Fair Lord, I pray thee let me never die until a good knight of my blood\nachieve the Sangreal, and I may see and kiss him", "' When he had thus\nprayed, he heard a voice that said, 'Thy prayers be heard and answered,\nfor thou shalt not die till that knight kiss thee; and when he cometh\nshall thine eyes be opened and thy wounds be healed", "' And now hath he\nlived here for three hundred winters in a holy life, and men say a\ncertain knight of King Arthur's court shall shortly heal him", "\"\n\nThereat Sir Percival marveled greatly, for he well knew who that knight\nshould be; and so, taking his leave of the monk, departed", "Then he rode on till noon, and came into a valley where he met twenty\nmen-at-arms bearing a dead knight on a bier", "And they cried to him,\n\"Whence comest thou?\"\n\n\"From King Arthur's court,\" he answered", "Then they all cried together, \"Slay him,\" and set upon him", "But he smote down the first man to the ground, and his horse upon him;\nwhereat seven of them all at once assailed him, and others slew his\nhorse", "Thus he had been either taken or slain, but by good chance Sir\nGalahad was passing by that way, who, seeing twenty men attacking one,\ncried, \"Slay him not,\" and rushed upon them; and, as fast as his horse\ncould drive, he encountered with the foremost man, and smote him down", "Then, his spear being broken, he drew forth his sword and struck out on\nthe right hand and on the left, at each blow smiting down a man, till\nthe remainder fled, and he pursued them", "Then Sir Percival, knowing that it was Sir Galahad, would fain have\novertaken him, but could not, for his horse was slain", "Yet followed he\non foot as fast as he could go; and as he went there met him a yeoman\nriding on a palfrey, and leading in his hand a great black steed", "So Sir\nPercival prayed him to lend him the steed, that he might overtake Sir\nGalahad", "But he replied, \"That can I not do, fair sir, for the horse is\nmy master's, and should I lend it he would slay me", "\" So he departed, and\nSir Percival sat down beneath a tree in heaviness of heart", "And as he\nsat, anon a knight went riding past on the black steed which the yeoman\nhad led", "And presently after came the yeoman back in haste, and asked\nSir Percival if he had seen a knight riding his horse", "\"Yea,\" said Sir Percival", "\"Alas,\" said the yeoman, \"he hath reft him from me by strength, and my\nmaster will slay me", "\"\n\nThen he besought Sir Percival to take his hackney and follow, and get\nback his steed", "So he rode quickly, and overtook the knight, and cried,\n\"Knight, turn again", "\" Whereat he turned and set his spear, and smote Sir\nPercival's hackney in the breast, so that it fell dead, and then went on\nhis way", "Then cried Sir Percival after him, \"Turn now, false knight, and\nfight with me on foot\"; but he would not, and rode out of sight", "Then was Sir Percival passing wroth and heavy of heart, and lay down to\nrest beneath a tree, and slept till midnight", "When he awoke he saw a\nwoman standing by him, who said to him right fiercely, \"Sir Percival,\nwhat doest thou here?\"\n\n\"I do neither good nor evil,\" said he", "\"If thou wilt promise me,\" said she, \"to do my will whenever I shall ask\nthee, I will bring thee here a horse that will bear thee wheresoever\nthou desirest", "\"\n\nAt that he was full glad, and promised as she asked", "Then anon she came\nagain, with a great black steed, strong and well appareled", "So Sir\nPercival mounted, and rode through the clear moonlight, and within less\nthan an hour had gone a four days' journey, till he came to a rough\nwater that roared; and his horse would have borne him into it, but Sir\nPercival would not suffer him, yet could he scarce restrain him", "And\nseeing the water so furious, he made the sign of the cross upon his\nforehead, whereat the horse suddenly shook him off, and with a terrible\nsound leaped into the water and disappeared, the waves all burning up in\nflames around him", "Then Sir Percival knew it was a fiend which had\nbrought him the horse; so he commended himself to God, and prayed that\nhe might escape temptations, and continued in prayer till it was day", "Then he saw that he was on a wild mountain, nigh surrounded on all sides\nby the sea, and filled with wild beasts; and going on into a valley, he\nsaw a serpent carrying a young lion by the neck", "With that came another\nlion, crying and roaring after the serpent, and anon overtook him, and\nbegan to battle with him", "And Sir Percival helped the lion, and drew his\nsword, and gave the serpent such a stroke that it fell dead", "Thereat the\nlion fawned upon him like a dog, licking his hands, and crouching at his\nfeet, and at night lay down by him and slept at his side", "And at noon the next day Sir Percival saw a ship come sailing before a\nstrong wind upon the sea towards him, and he rose and went towards it", "And when it came to shore, he found it covered with white samite, and on\nthe deck there stood an old man dressed in priest's robes, who said,\n\"God be with you, fair sir; whence come ye?\"\n\n\"I am a knight of King Arthur's court,\" said he, \"and follow the quest\nof the Sangreal; but here have I lost myself in this wilderness", "\"\n\n\"Fear nothing,\" said the old man, \"for I have come from a strange\ncountry to comfort thee", "\"\n\nThen he told Sir Percival it was a fiend of hell upon which he had\nridden to the sea, and that the lion, whom he had delivered from the\nserpent, meant the Church", "And Sir Percival rejoiced at these tidings,\nand entered into the ship, which presently sailed from the shore into\nthe sea", "Now when Sir Bors rode forth from Camelot to seek the Sangreal, anon he\nmet a holy man riding on an ass, and courteously saluted him", "\"Who are ye, son?\" said the good man", "\"I am a knight,\" said he, \"in quest of the Sangreal, and would fain have\nthy counsel, for he shall have much earthly honor who may bring it to a\nfavorable end", "\"\n\n\"That is truth,\" said the good man, \"for he shall be the best knight of\nthe world; yet know that none shall gain it save by sinless living", "\"\n\nSo they rode to his hermitage together, and there he prayed Sir Bors to\nabide that night, and anon they went into the chapel, and Sir Bors was\nconfessed", "And they eat bread and drank water together", "\"Now,\" said the hermit, \"I pray thee eat no other food till thou sit at\nthe table where the Sangreal shall be", "\" Thereto Sir Bors agreed", "\"Also,\" said the hermit, \"it were wise that ye should wear a sackcloth\ngarment next your skin, for penance\"; and in this also did Sir Bors as\nhe was counseled", "And afterwards he armed himself and took his leave", "Then rode he onwards all that day, and as he rode he saw a passing great\nbird sit in an old dry tree, whereon no leaves were left; and many\nlittle birds lay round the great one, nigh dead with hunger", "Then did\nthe big bird smite himself with his own bill, and bled till he died\namongst his little ones, and they recovered life in drinking up his\nblood", "When Sir Bors saw this he knew it was a token, and rode on full\nof thought", "And about eventide he came to a tower, whereto he prayed\nadmission, and he was received gladly by the lady of the castle", "But\nwhen a supper of many meats and dainties was set before him, he\nremembered his vow, and bade a squire to bring him water, and therein he\ndipped his bread, and ate", "Then said the lady, \"Sir Bors, I fear ye like not my meat", "\"\n\n\"Yea, truly,\" said he; \"God thank thee, madam; but I may eat no other\nmeat this day", "\"\n\nAfter supper came a squire, and said, \"Madam, bethink thee to provide a\nchampion for thee to-morrow for the tourney, or else shall thy sister\nhave thy castle", "\"\n\nAt that the lady wept, and made great sorrow", "But Sir Bors prayed her to\nbe comforted, and asked her why the tournament was held", "Then she told\nhim how she and her sister were the daughters of King Anianse, who left\nthem all his lands between them; and how her sister was the wife of a\nstrong knight, named Sir Pridan le Noir, who had taken from herself all\nher lands, save the one tower wherein she dwelt", "\"And now,\" said she,\n\"this also will they take, unless I find a champion by to-morrow", "\"\n\nThen said Sir Bors, \"Be comforted; to-morrow I will fight for thee\";\nwhereat she rejoiced not a little, and sent word to Sir Pridan that she\nwas provided and ready", "And Sir Bors lay on the floor, and in no bed,\nnor ever would do otherwise till he had achieved his quest", "On the morrow he arose and clothed himself, and went into the chapel,\nwhere the lady met him, and they heard mass together", "Anon he called for\nhis armor, and went with a goodly company of knights to the battle", "And\nthe lady prayed him to refresh himself ere he should fight, but he\nrefused to break his fast until the tournament were done", "So they all\nrode together to the lists, and there they saw the lady's eldest sister,\nand her husband, Sir Pridan le Noir", "And a cry was made by the heralds\nthat, whichever should win, his lady should have all the other's lands", "Then the two knights departed asunder a little space, and came together\nwith such force, that both their spears were shivered, and their shields\nand hauberks pierced through; and both fell to the ground sorely\nwounded, with their horses under them", "But swiftly they arose, and drew\ntheir swords, and smote each other on the head with many great and\nheavy blows, till the blood ran down their bodies; and Sir Pridan was a\nfull good knight, so that Sir Bors had more ado than he had thought for\nto overcome him", "But at last Sir Pridan grew a little faint; that instantly perceived Sir\nBors, and rushed upon him the more vehemently, and smote him fiercely,\ntill he rent off his helm, and then gave him great strokes upon his\nvisage with the flat of his sword, and bade him yield or be slain", "And then Sir Pridan cried him mercy, and said, \"For God's sake slay me\nnot, and I will never war against thy lady more", "\" So Sir Bors let him\ngo, and his wife fled away with all her knights", "Then all those who had held lands of the lady of the tower came and did\nhomage to her again, and swore fealty", "And when the country was at peace\nSir Bors departed, and rode forth into a forest until it was midday, and\nthere befell him a marvelous adventure", "For at a place where two ways parted, there met him two knights, bearing\nSir Lionel, his brother, all naked, bound on a horse, and as they rode,\nthey beat him sorely with thorns, so that the blood trailed down in more\nthan a hundred places from his body; but for all this he uttered no word\nor groan, so great he was of heart", "As soon as Sir Bors knew his\nbrother, he put his spear in rest to run and rescue him; but in the same\nmoment heard a woman's voice cry close beside him in the wood, \"St", "Mary, succor thy maid\"; and, looking round, he saw a damsel whom a felon\nknight dragged after him into the thickets; and she, perceiving him,\ncried piteously for help, and adjured him to deliver her as he was a\nsworn knight", "Then was Sir Bors sore troubled, and knew not what to do,\nfor he thought within himself, \"If I let my brother be, he will be\nmurdered; but if I help not the maid, she is shamed forever, and my vow\ncompelleth me to set her free; wherefore must I first help her, and\ntrust my brother unto God", "\"\n\nSo, riding to the knight who held the damsel, he cried out, \"Sir knight,\nlay your hand off that maid, or else ye be but dead", "\"\n\nAt that the knight set down the maid, and dropped his shield, and drew\nforth his sword against Sir Bors, who ran at him, and smote him through\nboth shield and shoulder, and threw him to the earth; and when he pulled\nhis spear forth, the knight swooned", "Then the maid thanked Sir Bors\nheartily, and he set her on the knight's horse, and brought her to her\nmen-at-arms, who presently came riding after her", "And they made much\njoy, and besought him to come to her father, a great lord, and he should\nbe right welcome", "But \"truly,\" said he, \"I may not at this time, for I\nhave a great adventure yet to do\"; and commending them to God, he\ndeparted in great haste to find his brother", "So he rode, seeking him by the track of the horses a great while", "Anon\nhe met a seeming holy man riding upon a strong black horse, and asked\nhim, had he seen pass by that way a knight led bound and beaten with\nthorns by two others", "\"Yea, truly, such an one I saw,\" said the man; \"but he is dead, and lo!\nhis body is hard by in a bush", "\"\n\nThen he showed him a newly slain body lying in a thick bush, which\nseemed indeed to be Sir Lionel", "Then made Sir Bors such mourning and\nsorrow that by-and-by he fell into a swoon upon the ground", "And when he\ncame to himself again, he took the body in his arms and put it on his\nhorse's saddle, and bore it to a chapel hard by, and would have buried\nit", "But when he made the sign of the cross, he heard a full great noise\nand cry as though all the fiends of hell had been about him, and\nsuddenly the body and the chapel and the old man vanished all away", "Then\nhe knew that it was the devil who had thus beguiled him, and that his\nbrother yet lived", "Then held he up his hands to heaven, and thanked God for his own escape\nfrom hurt, and rode onwards; and anon, as he passed by an hermitage in a\nforest, he saw his brother sitting armed by the door", "And when he saw\nhim he was filled with joy, and lighted from his horse, and ran to him\nand said, \"Fair brother, when came ye hither?\"\n\nBut Sir Lionel answered, with an angry face, \"What vain words be these,\nwhen for you I might have been slain? Did ye not see me bound and led\naway to death, and left me in that peril to go succoring a gentlewoman,\nthe like whereof no brother ever yet hath done? Now, for thy false\nmisdeed, I do defy thee, and ensure thee speedy death", "\"\n\nThen Sir Bors prayed his brother to abate his anger, and said, \"Fair\nbrother, remember the love that should be between us twain", "\"\n\nBut Sir Lionel would not hear, and prepared to fight, and mounted his\nhorse and came before him, crying, \"Sir Bors, keep thee from me, for I\nshall do to thee as a felon and a traitor; therefore, start upon thy\nhorse, for if thou wilt not, I will run upon thee as thou standest", "\"\n\nBut for all his words Sir Bors would not defend himself against his\nbrother", "And anon the fiend stirred up Sir Lionel to such rage, that he\nrushed over him and overthrew him with his horse's hoofs, so that he lay\nswooning on the ground", "Then would he have rent off his helm and slain\nhim, but the hermit of that place ran out, and prayed him to forbear,\nand shielded Sir Bors with his body", "Then Sir Lionel cried out, \"Now, God so help me, sir priest, but I shall\nslay thee else thou depart, and him too after thee", "\"\n\nAnd when the good man utterly refused to leave Sir Bors, he smote him on\nthe head until he died, and then he took his brother by the helm and\nunlaced it, to have stricken off his head, and so he would have done,\nbut suddenly was pulled off backwards by a knight of the Round Table,\nwho, by the will of Heaven, was passing by that place--Sir Colgrevance\nby name", "\"Sir Lionel,\" he cried, \"will ye slay your brother, one of the best\nknights of all the world? That ought no man to suffer", "\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Sir Lionel, \"will ye hinder me and meddle in this strife?\nbeware, lest I shall slay both thee and him", "\"\n\nAnd when Sir Colgrevance refused to let them be, Sir Lionel defied him,\nand gave him a great stroke through the helmet, whereat Sir Colgrevance\ndrew his sword, and smote again right manfully", "And so long they fought\ntogether that Sir Bors awoke from his swoon, and tried to rise and part\nthem, but had no strength to stand upon his feet", "Anon Sir Colgrevance saw him, and cried out to him for help, for now Sir\nLionel had nigh defeated him", "When Sir Bors heard that, he struggled to\nhis feet, and put his helmet on, and took his sword", "But before he could\ncome to him, Sir Lionel had smitten off Sir Colgrevance's helm, and\nthrown him to the earth and slain him", "Then turned he to his brother as\na man possessed by fiends, and gave him such a stroke as bent him nearly\ndouble", "But Sir Bors prayed him for God's sake to quit that battle, \"For if it\nbefell us that we either slew the other we should die for care of that\nsin", "\"\n\n\"Never will I spare thee if I master thee,\" cried out Sir Lionel", "Then Sir Bors drew his sword all weeping, and said, \"Now, God have mercy\non me, though I defend my life against my brother\"; with that he lifted\nup his sword to strike, but suddenly he heard a mighty voice, \"Put up\nthy sword, Sir Bors, and flee, or thou shalt surely slay him", "\" And then\nthere fell upon them both a fiery cloud, which flamed and burned their\nshields, and they fell to the earth in sore dread", "Anon Sir Bors rose to his feet, and saw that Sir Lionel had taken no\nharm", "Then came the voice again, and said, \"Sir Bors, go hence and leave\nthy brother, and ride thou forward to the sea, for there Sir Percival\nabideth thee", "\"\n\nThen he said to his brother, \"Brother, forgive me all my trespass\nagainst thee", "\"\n\nAnd Sir Lionel answered, \"God forgive it thee, as I do", "\"\n\nThen he departed and rode to the sea, and on the strand he found a ship\nall covered with white samite, and as soon as he had entered thereinto,\nit put forth from the shore", "And in the midst of the ship there stood an\narmed knight, whom he knew to be Sir Percival", "Then they rejoiced\ngreatly over each other, and said, \"We lack nothing now but the good\nknight Sir Galahad", "\"\n\nNow when Sir Galahad had rescued Sir Percival from the twenty knights he\nrode into a vast forest", "And after many days it befell that he came to a\ncastle whereat was a tournament", "And the knights of the castle were put\nto the worse; which when he saw, he set his spear in rest and ran to\nhelp them, and smote down many of their adversaries", "And as it chanced,\nSir Gawain was amongst the stranger knights, and when he saw the white\nshield with the red cross, he knew it was Sir Galahad, and proffered to\njoust with him", "So they encountered, and having broken their spears,\nthey drew their swords, and Sir Galahad smote Sir Gawain so sorely on\nthe helm that he clove it through, and struck on slanting to the earth,\ncarving the horse's shoulder in twain, and Sir Gawain fell to the earth", "Then Sir Galahad beat back all who warred against the castle, yet would\nhe not wait for thanks, but rode away that no man might know him", "And he rested that night at a hermitage, and when he was asleep, he\nheard a knocking at the door", "So he rose, and found a damsel there, who\nsaid, \"Sir Galahad, I will that ye arm you, and mount upon your horse\nand follow me, for I will show you within these three days the highest\nadventure that ever any knight saw", "\"\n\nAnon Sir Galahad armed him, and took his horse, and commended himself to\nGod, and bade the gentlewoman go, and he would follow where she liked", "So they rode onwards to the sea as fast as their horses might gallop,\nand at night they came to a castle in a valley, inclosed by running\nwater, and by strong and high walls, whereinto they entered and had\ngreat cheer, for the lady of the castle was the damsel's mistress", "And when he was unarmed, the damsel said to her lady, \"Madam, shall we\nabide here this night?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said she, \"but only till he hath dined and slept a little", "\"\n\nSo he ate and slept a while, till the maid called him, and armed him by\ntorchlight; and when he had saluted the lady of the castle, the damsel\nand Sir Galahad rode on", "Anon they came to the seaside, and lo! the ship, wherein were Sir\nPercival and Sir Bors, abode by the shore", "Then they cried, \"Welcome,\nSir Galahad, for we have awaited thee long", "\"\n\nThen they rejoiced to see each other, and told of all their adventures\nand temptations", "And the damsel went into the ship with them, and spake\nto Sir Percival: \"Sir Percival, know ye not who I am?\"\n\nAnd he replied, \"Nay, certainly, I know thee not", "\"\n\nThen said she, \"I am thy sister, the daughter of King Pellinore, and am\nsent to help thee and these knights, thy fellows, to achieve the quest\nwhich ye all follow", "\"\n\nSo Sir Percival rejoiced to see his sister, and they departed from the\nshore", "And after a while they came upon a whirlpool, where their ship\ncould not live", "Then saw they another greater ship hard by and went\ntowards it, but saw neither man nor woman therein", "And on the end of it\nthese words were written, \"Thou who shalt enter me, beware that thou be\nin steadfast belief, for I am Faith; and if thou doubtest, I cannot help\nthee", "\" Then were they all adread, but, commending themselves to God,\nthey entered in", "As soon as they were on board they saw a fair bed, whereon lay a crown\nof silk, and at the foot was a fair and rich sword drawn from its\nscabbard half a foot and more", "The pommel was of precious stones of many\ncolors, every color having a different virtue, and the scales of the\nhaft were of two ribs of different beasts", "The one was bone of a serpent\nfrom Calidone forest, named the serpent of the fiend; and its virtue\nsaveth all men who hold it from weariness", "The other was of a fish that\nhaunteth the floods of Euphrates, named Ertanax; and its virtue causeth\nwhoever holdeth it to forget all other things, whether of joy or pain,\nsave the thing he seeth before him", "\"In the name of God,\" said Sir Percival, \"I shall assay to handle this\nsword\"; and set his hand to it, but could not grasp it", "\"By my faith,\"\nsaid he, \"now have I failed", "\"\n\nSir Bors set his hand to it, and failed also", "Then came Sir Galahad, and saw these letters written red as blood, \"None\nshall draw me forth save the hardiest of all men;

and though before\nthee some have dared to raise it, yet have they all been maimed or\nwounded for their daring", "\"\n\n\"Where,\" said Sir Galahad, \"shall we find a girdle for it?\"\n\n\"Fair sir,\" said she, \"dismay you not\"; and therewith took from out a\nbox a girdle, nobly wrought with golden thread, set full of precious\nstones and with a rich gold buckle", "\"This girdle, lords,\" said she, \"is\nmade for the most part of mine own hair, which, while I was yet in the\nworld, I loved full well; but when I knew that this adventure was\nordained me, I cut off and wove as ye now see", "\"\n\nThen they all prayed Sir Galahad to take the sword, and so anon he\ngripped it in his fingers; and the maiden girt it round his waist,\nsaying, \"Now reck I not though I die, for I have made thee the worthiest\nknight of all the world", "\"\n\n\"Fair damsel,\" said Sir Galahad, \"ye have done so much that I shall be\nyour knight all the days of my life", "\"\n\nThen the ship sailed a great way on the sea, and brought them to land\nnear the Castle of Carteloise", "When they were landed came a squire and\nasked them, \"Be ye of King Arthur's court?\"\n\n\"We are,\" said they", "\"In an evil hour are ye come,\" said he, and went back swiftly to the\ncastle", "Within a while they heard a great horn blow, and saw a multitude of\nwell-armed knights come forth, who bade them yield or die", "At that they\nran together, and Sir Percival smote one to the earth and mounted his\nhorse, and so likewise did Sir Bors and Sir Galahad, and soon had they\nrouted all their enemies and alighted on foot, and with their swords\nslew them downright, and entered into the castle", "Then came there forth a priest, to whom Sir Galahad kneeled and said,\n\"In sooth, good father, I repent me of this slaughter; but we were first\nassailed, or else it had not been", "\"\n\n\"Repent ye not,\" said the good man, \"for if ye lived as long as the\nworld lasted ye could do no better deed, for these were all the felon\nsons of a good knight, Earl Hernox, whom they have thrown into a\ndungeon, and in his name have slain priests and clerks, and beat down\nchapels far and near", "\"\n\nThen Sir Galahad prayed the priest to bring him to the earl;

and marveling greatly at that sight, they followed", "Anon they came to a hermitage and a chapel, whereunto the hart entered,\nand the lions with it", "Then a priest offered mass, and presently they\nsaw the hart change into the figure of a man, most sweet and comely to\nbehold; and the four lions also changed and became a man, an eagle, a\nlion, and an ox", "And suddenly all those five figures vanished without\nsound", "Then the knights marveled greatly, and fell upon their knees, and\nwhen they rose they prayed the priest to tell them what that sight might\nmean", "\"What saw ye, sirs?\" said he, \"for I saw nothing", "\" Then they told him", "\"Ah, lords!\" said he, \"ye are full welcome; now know I well ye be the\nknights who shall achieve the Sangreal, for unto them alone such\nmysteries are revealed", "The hart ye saw is One above all men, white and\nwithout blemish, and the four lions with Him are the four evangelists", "\"\n\nWhen they heard that they heartily rejoiced, and thanking the priest,\ndeparted", "Anon, as they passed by a certain castle, an armed knight suddenly came\nafter them, and cried out to the damsel, \"By the holy cross, ye shall\nnot go till ye have yielded to the custom of the castle", "\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" said Sir Percival, \"for a maiden, wheresoever she cometh,\nis free", "\"\n\n\"Whatever maiden passeth here,\" replied the knight, \"must give a dishful\nof her blood from her right arm", "\"\n\n\"It is a foul and shameful custom,\" cried Sir Galahad and both his\nfellows, \"and sooner will we die than let this maiden yield thereto", "\"\n\n\"Then shall ye die,\" replied the knight, and as he spake there came out\nfrom a gate hard by, ten or twelve more, and encountered with them,\nrunning upon them vehemently with a great cry", "But the three knights\nwithstood them, and set their hands to their swords, and beat them down\nand slew them", "At that came forth a company of threescore knights, all armed", "\"Fair\nlords,\" said Sir Galahad, \"have mercy on yourselves and keep from us", "\"\n\n\"Nay, fair lords,\" they answered, \"rather be advised by us, and yield ye\nto our custom", "\"\n\n\"It is an idle word,\" said Galahad, \"in vain ye speak it", "\"\n\n\"Well,\" said they, \"will ye die?\"\n\n\"We be not come thereto as yet,\" replied Sir Galahad", "Then did they fall upon each other, and Sir Galahad drew forth his\nsword, and smote on the right hand and on the left, and slew so mightily\nthat all who saw him thought he was a monster and no earthly man", "And\nboth his comrades helped him well, and so they held the field against\nthat multitude till it was night", "Then came a good knight forward from\nthe enemy and said, \"Fair knights, abide with us to-night and be right\nwelcome; by the faith of our bodies as we are true knights, to-morrow ye\nshall rise unharmed, and meanwhile maybe ye will, of your own accord,\naccept the custom of the castle when ye know it better", "\"\n\nSo they entered and alighted and made great cheer", "Anon, they asked them\nwhence that custom came", "\"The lady of this castle is a leper,\" said\nthey, \"and can be no way cured save by the blood of a pure virgin and a\nking's daughter; therefore to save her life are we her servants bound to\nstay every maid that passeth by, and try if her blood may not cure our\nmistress", "\"\n\nThen said the damsel, \"Take ye of my blood as much as ye will, if it may\navail your lady", "\"\n\nAnd though the three knights urged her not to put her life in that great\nperil, she replied, \"If I die to heal another's body, I shall get health\nto my soul,\" and would not be persuaded to refuse", "So on the morrow she was brought to the sick lady, and her arm was\nbared, and a vein thereof was opened, and the dish filled with her\nblood", "Then the sick lady was anointed therewith, and anon she was whole\nof her malady", "With that Sir Percival's sister lifted up her hand and\nblessed her, saying, \"Madam, I am come to my death to make you whole;\nfor God's love pray for me\";

but never would he suffer any to go\nforth and attack one of the king's army, for he was right loth to fight\nagainst him", "So when fifteen weeks were passed, and King Arthur's army wasted itself\nin vain against the castle, for it was passing strong, it chanced upon a\nday Sir Lancelot was looking from the walls and espied King Arthur and\nSir Gawain close beside", "\"Come forth, Sir Lancelot,\" said King Arthur right fiercely, \"and let us\ntwo meet in the midst of the field", "\"\n\n\"God forbid that I should encounter with thee, lord, for thou didst make\nme a knight,\" replied Sir Lancelot", "Then cried Sir Gawain, \"Shame on thee, traitor and false knight, yet be\nye well assured we will regain the queen and slay thee and thy company;\nyea, double shame on ye to slay my brother Gaheris unarmed, Sir Gareth\nalso, who loved ye so well", "For that treachery, be sure I am thine enemy\ntill death", "\"\n\n\"Alas!\" cried Sir Lancelot, \"that I hear such tidings, for I knew not I\nhad slain those noble knights, and right sorely now do I repent it with\na heavy heart", "Yet abate thy wrath, Sir Gawain, for ye know full well I\ndid it by mischance, for I loved them ever as my own brothers", "\"\n\n\"Thou liest, false recreant,\" cried Sir Gawain, fiercely", "At that Sir Lancelot was wroth, and said, \"I well see thou art now mine\nenemy, and that there can be no more peace with thee, or with my lord\nthe king, else would I gladly give back the queen", "\"\n\nThen the king would fain have listened to Sir Lancelot, for more than\nall his own wrong did he grieve at the sore waste and damage of the\nrealm, but Sir Gawain persuaded him against it, and ever cried out\nfoully on Sir Lancelot", "When Sir Bors and the other knights of Lancelot's party heard the fierce\nwords of Sir Gawain, they were passing wroth, and prayed to ride forth\nand be avenged on him, for they were weary of so long waiting to no\ngood", "And in the end Sir Lancelot, with a heavy heart, consented", "So on the morrow the hosts on either side met in the field, and there\nwas a great battle", "And Sir Gawain prayed his knights chiefly to set\nupon Sir Lancelot; but Sir Lancelot commanded his company to forbear\nKing Arthur and Sir Gawain", "So the two armies jousted together right fiercely, and Sir Gawain\nproffered to encounter with Sir Lionel, and overthrew him", "But Sir Bors\nand Sir Blamor, and Sir Palomedes, who were on Sir Lancelot's side, did\ngreat feats of arms, and overthrew many of King Arthur's knights", "Then the king came forth against Sir Lancelot, but Sir Lancelot forbore\nhim and would not strike again", "At that Sir Bors rode up against the king and smote him down", "But Sir\nLancelot cried, \"Touch him not on pain of thy head,\" and going to King\nArthur he alighted and gave him his own horse, saying, \"My lord, I pray\nthee forbear this strife, for it can bring to neither of us any honor", "\"\n\nAnd when King Arthur looked on him the tears came to his eyes as he\nthought of his noble courtesy, and he said within himself, \"Alas! that\never this war began", "\"\n\nBut on the morrow Sir Gawain led forth the army again, and Sir Bors\ncommanded on Sir Lancelot's side", "And they two struck together so\nfiercely that both fell to the ground sorely wounded; and all the day\nthey fought till night fell, and many were slain on both sides, yet in\nthe end neither gained the victory", "But by now the fame of this fierce war spread through all Christendom,\nand when the Pope heard thereof he sent a Bull, and charged King Arthur\nto make peace with Lancelot, and receive back Queen Guinevere; and for\nthe offense imputed to her absolution should be given by the Pope", "Thereto would King Arthur straightway have obeyed, but Sir Gawain ever\nurged him to refuse", "When Sir Lancelot heard thereof, he wrote thus to the king: \"It was\nnever in my thought, lord, to withhold thy queen from thee; but since\nshe was condemned for my sake to death, I deemed it but a just and\nknightly part to rescue her therefrom; wherefore I recommend me to your\ngrace, and within eight days will I come to thee and bring the queen in\nsafety", "\"\n\nThen, within eight days, as he had said, Sir Lancelot rode from out the\ncastle with Queen Guinevere, and a hundred knights for company, each\ncarrying an olive branch, in sign of peace", "And so they came to the\ncourt, and found King Arthur sitting on his throne, with Sir Gawain and\nmany other knights around him", "And when Sir Lancelot entered with the\nqueen, they both kneeled down before the king", "Anon Sir Lancelot rose and said, \"My lord, I have brought hither my lady\nthe queen again, as right requireth, and by commandment of the Pope and\nyou", "I pray ye take her to your heart again and forget the past", "For\nmyself I may ask nothing, and for my sin I shall have sorrow and sore\npunishment; yet I would to heaven I might have your grace", "\"\n\nBut ere the king could answer, for he was moved with pity at his words,\nSir Gawain cried aloud, \"Let the king do as he will, but be sure, Sir\nLancelot, thou and I shall never be accorded while we live, for thou has\nslain my brethren traitorously and unarmed", "\"\n\n\"As heaven is my help,\" replied Sir Lancelot, \"I did it ignorantly, for\nI loved them well, and while I live I shall bewail their death; but to\nmake war with me were no avail, for I must needs fight with thee if thou\nassailest, and peradventure I might kill thee also, which I were right\nloth to do", "\"\n\n\"I will forgive thee never,\" cried Sir Gawain, \"and if the king\naccordeth with thee he shall lose my service", "\"\n\nThen the knights who stood near tried to reconcile Sir Gawain to Sir\nLancelot, but he would not hear them", "So, at the last, Sir Lancelot\nsaid, \"Since peace is vain, I will depart, lest I bring more evil on my\nfellowship", "\"\n\nAnd as he turned to go, the tears fell from him, and he said, \"Alas,\nmost noble Christian realm, which I have loved above all others, now\nshall I see thee never more!\" Then said he to the queen, \"Madam, now\nmust I leave ye and this noble fellowship forever", "And, I beseech ye,\npray for me, and if ye ever be defamed of any, let me hear thereof, and\nas I have been ever thy true knight in right and wrong, so will I be\nagain", "\"\n\nWith that he kneeled and kissed King Arthur's hands, and departed on his\nway", "And there was none in all that court, save Sir Gawain alone, but\nwept to see him go", "So he returned with all his knights to the Castle of La Joyous Garde,\nand, for his sorrow's sake, he named it Dolorous Garde thenceforth", "Anon he left the realm, and went with many of his fellowship beyond the\nsea to France, and there divided all his lands among them equally, he\nsharing but as the rest", "And from that time forward peace had been between him and King Arthur,\nbut for Sir Gawain, who left the king no rest, but constantly persuaded\nhim that Lancelot was raising mighty hosts against him", "So in the end his malice overcame the king, who left the government in\ncharge of Modred, and made him guardian of the queen, and went with a\ngreat army to invade Sir Lancelot's lands", "Yet Sir Lancelot would make no war upon the king, and sent a message to\ngain peace on any terms King Arthur chose", "But Sir Gawain met the herald\nere he reached the king, and sent him back with taunting and bitter\nwords", "Whereat Sir Lancelot sorrowfully called his knights together and\nfortified the Castle of Benwicke, and there was shortly besieged by the\narmy of King Arthur", "And every day Sir Gawain rode up to the walls, and cried out foully on\nSir Lancelot, till, upon a time, Sir Lancelot answered him that he would\nmeet him in the field and put his boasting to the proof", "So it was\nagreed on both sides that there should none come nigh them or separate\nthem till one had fallen or yielded; and they two rode forth", "Then did they wheel their horses apart, and turning, came together as it\nhad been thunder, so that both horses fell, and both their lances broke", "At that they drew their swords and set upon each other fiercely, with\npassing grievous strokes", "Now Sir Gawain had through magic a marvelous great gift", "For every day,\nfrom morning till noon, his strength waxed to the might of seven men,\nbut after that waned to his natural force", "Therefore till noon he gave\nSir Lancelot many mighty buffets, which scarcely he endured", "Yet greatly\nhe forbore Sir Gawain, for he was aware of his enchantment, and smote\nhim slightly till his own knights marveled", "But after noon Sir Gawain's\nstrength sank fast, and then, with one full blow, Sir Lancelot laid him\non the earth", "Then Sir Gawain cried out, \"Turn not away, thou traitor\nknight, but slay me if thou wilt, or else I will arise and fight with\nthee again some other time", "\"\n\n\"Sir knight,\" replied Sir Lancelot, \"I never yet smote a fallen man", "\"\n\nAt that they bore Sir Gawain sorely wounded to his tent, and King Arthur\nwithdrew his men, for he was loth to shed the blood of so many knights\nof his own fellowship", "But now came tidings to King Arthur from across the sea, which caused\nhim to return in haste", "For thus the news ran, that no sooner was Sir\nModred set up in his regency, than he had forged false tidings from\nabroad that the king had fallen in a battle with Sir Lancelot", "Whereat\nhe had proclaimed himself the king, and had been crowned at Canterbury,\nwhere he had held a coronation feast for fifteen days", "Then he had gone\nto Winchester, where Queen Guinevere abode, and had commanded her to be\nhis wife; whereto, for fear and sore perplexity, she had feigned\nconsent, but, under pretext of preparing for the marriage, had fled in\nhaste to London and taken shelter in the Tower, fortifying it and\nproviding it with all manner of victuals, and defending it against Sir\nModred, and answering to all his threats that she would rather slay\nherself than be his queen", "Thus was it written to King Arthur", "Then, in passing great wrath and\nhaste, he came with all his army swiftly back from France and sailed to\nEngland", "But when Sir Modred heard thereof, he left the Tower and\nmarched with all his host to meet the king at Dover", "Then fled Queen Guinevere to Amesbury to a nunnery, and there she\nclothed herself in sackcloth, and spent her time in praying for the king\nand in good deeds and fasting", "And in that nunnery evermore she lived,\nsorely repenting and mourning for her sin, and for the ruin she had\nbrought on all the realm", "And there anon she died", "And when Sir Lancelot heard thereof, he put his knightly armor off, and\nbade farewell to all his kin, and went a mighty pilgrimage for many\nyears, and after lived a hermit till his death", "When Sir Modred came to Dover, he found King Arthur and his army but\njust landed;

\"in Sir Lancelot and in you I had my greatest earthly joy, and\nnow is all gone from me", "\"\n\nAnd Sir Gawain answered, with a feeble voice, \"My lord and king, I know\nwell my death is come, and through my own wilfulness, for I am smitten\nin the wound Sir Lancelot gave me", "Alas! that I have been the cause of\nall this war, for but for me thou hadst been now at peace with Lancelot,\nand then had Modred never done this treason", "I pray ye, therefore, my\ndear lord, be now agreed with Lancelot, and tell him, that although he\ngave me my death-wound, it was through my own seeking;

and\nprayed him to delay till Lancelot and his knights should come to aid\nhim", "So when King Arthur woke he told his lords and knights that vision, and\nall agreed to wait the coming of Sir Lancelot", "Then a herald was sent\nwith a message of truce to Sir Modred, and a treaty was made that\nneither army should assail the other", "But when the treaty was agreed upon, and the heralds returned, King\nArthur said to his knights, \"Beware, lest Sir Modred deceive us, for I\nin no wise trust him, and if swords be drawn be ready to encounter!\" And\nSir Modred likewise gave an order, that if any man of the king's army\ndrew his sword, they should begin to fight", "And as it chanced, a knight of the king's side was bitten by an adder in\nthe foot, and hastily drew forth his sword to slay it", "That saw Sir\nModred, and forthwith commanded all his army to assail the king's", "So both sides rushed to battle, and fought passing fiercely", "And when\nthe king saw there was no hope to stay them, he did right mightily and\nnobly as a king should do, and ever, like a lion, raged in the thickest\nof the press, and slew on the right hand and on the left, till his horse\nwent fetlock deep in blood", "So all day long they fought, and stinted not\ntill many a noble knight was slain", "But the king was passing sorrowful to see his trusty knights lie dead on\nevery side", "And at the last but two remained beside him, Sir Lucan, and\nhis brother, Sir Bedivere, and both were sorely wounded", "\"Now am I come to mine end,\" said King Arthur; \"but, lo! that traitor\nModred liveth yet, and I may not die till I have slain him", "Now, give me\nmy spear, Sir Lucan", "\"\n\n\"Lord, let him be,\" replied Sir Lucan; \"for if ye pass through this\nunhappy day, ye shall be right well revenged upon him", "My good lord,\nremember well your dream, and what the spirit of Sir Gawain did\nfore-warn ye", "\"\n\n\"Betide me life, betide me death,\" said the king;

\"twice hast thou now\nbetrayed me", "Art thou called of men a noble knight, and wouldest betray\nme for a jewelled sword? Now, therefore, go again for the last time, for\nthy tarrying hath put me in sore peril of my life, and I fear my wound\nhath taken cold; and if thou do it not this time, by my faith I will\narise and slay thee with my hands", "\"\n\nThen Sir Bedivere ran quickly and took up the sword, and went down to\nthe water's edge, and bound the girdle round the hilt and threw it far\ninto the water", "And lo! an arm and hand came forth above the water, and\ncaught the sword, and brandished it three times, and vanished", "So Sir Bedivere came again to the king and told him what he had seen", "\"Help me from hence,\" said King Arthur; \"for I dread me I have tarried\nover long", "\"\n\nThen Sir Bedivere took the king up in his arms, and bore him to the\nwater's edge", "And by the shore they saw a barge with three fair queens\ntherein, all dressed in black, and when they saw King Arthur they wept\nand wailed", "\"Now put me in the barge,\" said he to Sir Bedivere, and tenderly he did\nso", "Then the three queens received him, and he laid his head upon the lap of\none of them, who cried, \"Alas! dear brother, why have ye tarried so\nlong, for your wound hath taken cold?\"\n\nWith that the barge put from the land, and when Sir Bedivere saw it\ndeparting, he cried with a bitter cry, \"Alas! my lord King Arthur, what\nshall become of me now ye have gone from me?\"\n\n\"Comfort ye,\" said King Arthur, \"and be strong, for I may no more help\nye", "I go to the Vale of Avilion to heal me of my grievous wound, and if\nye see me no more, pray for my soul", "\"\n\nThen the three queens kneeled down around the king and sorely wept and\nwailed, and the barge went forth to sea, and departed slowly out of Sir\nBedivere's sight", "THE END"]

       <!-- <p><strong>18/Sep/2025.__</strong>&nbsp &nbsp EOF is our normal form.</p> -->
        <p><strong>30/Dec/2025.__</strong>&nbsp &nbsp I hope everybody had a nice Christmas. When you're a kid the 25th seems like it will never come.
        As an adult running against the clock, you find yourself enjoying Christmas better after it is past. Or before, when you haven't realized yet
    you are already late. So since it is time now to fully enjoy it, Merry Christmas everybody! </p>
    
        <p><strong>13/Dec/2025.__</strong>&nbsp &nbsp It has been a while since the last billet. School is pretty cool. 
            Being interested in what you do is always refreshing. The Great Eye of job hunting is looking for me though. 
            I guess it is a <i>res, non verba</i> case?
            Anyway, my friend Kiki has started to bake bread at home, so I made her a bunch of dough calculators in JavaScript. 
            This one is for you Kiki, good luck! I will add the sour bread one soon.</p>

        <p><strong>31/Oct/2025.__</strong>&nbsp &nbsp Happy Halloween! I was accepted in a programming school. 
            This means I will be able to focus full time and hopefully find a job. 
            I can't wait to start and feel extremely grateful for this opportunity.</p>

        <p><strong>12/Sep/2025.__</strong>&nbsp &nbsp As life goes on, I lost touch with many friends and many people.
        Some of them are no longer topologically available, so there won't be any get back in touch in this plane but
        I still sometimes get flash of memories. Following the path of your mind's graph, you just ended up on a barely connected vertex, maybe a pendant one. Nothing special, it happens to all of us. Still it always feels very strange to
        get vivid memories back in an instant that were completely lost in the wasteland. When they come back, I sometimes
        write down the ones I cherish to reconnect them more firmly to the graph. I believe you have to, because you never know if they'll ever come back to conscience as you might never walk back there otherwise.
        Just like you would cross path with an old friend at the most unlikely time and place.</p>
        I wish them all the best, as above so below.

        <p><strong>10/Sep/2025.__</strong>&nbsp &nbsp Since the website is mostly done, I need to find another project. Maybe I could try to implement lambda calculus? 
        The language could be called Mary - she had a little lambda 'fter all.
        Or maybe a simple type system? Recently, I am backing up my data on a new HDD. Its sound at night is a lullaby to my tired dreams. Brrr takakatac. Tactac... Tac.</p>

        <p><strong>7/Sep/2025.__</strong>&nbsp &nbsp I haven't written any code since the RSS feed. What I need is a nice project, I can start and focus on.

        <p><strong>2/Sep/2025.__</strong>&nbsp &nbsp I would like to make a RSS feed for this website. I just recently started using it to read stuff online, 
        as using a web browser or a search engine seems to be less and less enjoyable to me. It feels like going to an over crowded supermarket or convention 
        were everybody is trying to grab your attention or your money. To paraphrase the great Umberto Eco, any communication system that becomes successful looses its usability.
        RSS seems very neat for clarity, so I want to know how it works. Making a feed for this little personal website is the perfect way to learn. 
        Is that all for today? Well, it seems so. Maybe I will add the Eco quote later today. If I can find it back.</p>
    

        <p><strong>31/Aug/2025.__</strong>&nbsp &nbsp I made bread today, Lodève style which simply put is 
        a highly hydrated dough with no shaping prior baking. I used a mix of sourdough and yeast, as I do when my sourdough is not as active
        as it should. Anyway, the result was not bad. Maybe I'll update a picture. Staying on baking, as autumn arrives, at least from a calendar point of view,
        I feel I will get soon the urge to bake bretzels and some petits janots. I also made lacto-fermented mustard the other day. I have not tasted it yet. 
        I think I let it ferment for too long as the smell was quite concentrated. If the taste is too strong to my taste, I will just cook it with chicken in the oven.
        This billet is very dominical. Always a lot of food preparation and consumption on sundays. I have two great men in mind lately,
        Gaston Bachelard and Marcel Légaut. Both had very interesting lives, both were greatly driven. Both found or atteigned their calling
        very late in life. Both became lovely grand-father figures. How weird must it be to become somebody so new and so successful may I say carefully,
        after having lived already so long. And above all, what a joy must it be, to finally be yourself.</p>
                
        <p><strong>29/Aug/2025.__</strong>&nbsp &nbsp I was listening to some Dungeon Synth, or Fantasy Synth however you prefer to call it.
        It made me realize that I have a taste for poor sounds - harmonically speaking - in music. My current understand of it, 
        is that such sounds leave room for imagination just like pixelated art would. Sometimes a monochrome low resolution image is plenty in a game. 
        High definition graphics can surely be inspiring and beautiful, but partial information has its own merits.
        This kind of aridity provides the mind with a great wealth of details, a richness that you get in return of low resolution. 
        It is similar in a way to books, they let you imagine were movies give you the answer, as my mum used to say. 
        </p>

        <p><strong>28/Aug/2025.__</strong>&nbsp &nbsp Studying gets very hard lately. Somedays, I only get 30 minutes at night - maybe around 21h30 - and then the energy tank is empty.<br>
        This can be a problem during in-betweens: after a project is over, a pdf, a class, or simply when you've been stuck on something for too long and looking at it just burns your eyes.
        So when the flow is broken, 30 minutes on a out of mana brain is tough. It also does not help, that I was planning to start working on "Writing a C Compiler" which has a fast paced first chapter to say the least.
        I does not help that I am still recovering from Covid, which gave some bad brain fog. No incantation could help. Anyway, what was this <em>billet</em> about? Fireballs yeah! 
        Frrrrrrrshhh! On empty days, maybe I should just softly work on this website. Being kind to yourself is powerful magic sometimes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>17/Aug/2025.__</strong>&nbsp &nbsp So, I've been learning programming for almost three years now.
        I started with Python as it is very much recommended for beginners, then I went to Rust and now OCaml because of my interest in compilers and programming language design.
        I would like to become a pro sometime in the future. Compilers might not exactly be the best interest to have to find a junior level job - if such thing still exists today.<br>
        However, I do believe in the well-known wisdom saying that the journey is the important part. From that point of view, 
        learning something you like over something that would get faster results might be a reasonable alternative. Especially if we consider the fact that I might never be able to get employed.
        What a waste would it be to learn something only for a result that never comes.</p>
